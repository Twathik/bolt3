Metabolism
Abacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with 
approximately 2% of the administered dose being renally 
excreted, as unchanged compound. The primary pathways 
of metabolism in man are by alcohol dehydrogenase and 
by glucuronidation to produce the 5'-carboxylic acid 
and 5'-glucuronide which account for about 66% of the 
administered dose. The metabolites are excreted in the 
urine.

After oral administration, there is rapid formation of a 
major equiactive metabolite, diacetolol, which possesses 
a similar pharmacological profile to acebutolol. Peak 
plasma concentrations of active material (i.e. acebutolol 
plus diacetolol) are achieved within 2–4 hours and the 
terminal plasma elimination half-life is around 8–10 
hours. Because of biliary excretion and direct transfer 
across the gut wall from the systemic circulation to the 
gut lumen, more than 50% of an oral dose of acebutolol is 
recovered in the faeces with acebutolol and diacetolol in 
equal proportions; the rest of the dose is recovered in the 
urine, mainly as diacetolol.

Potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs
•
Analgesics: high dose aspirin reduces excretion (risk 
of toxicity).
•
Anti-arrhythmics: increased toxicity if hypokalaemia 
occurs.
•
Antibacterials: effects of methenamine antagonised.
•
Antiepileptics: increased risk of osteomalacia 
with phenytoin and phenobarbital; concentration 
of carbamazepine and possibly fosphenytoin and 
phenytoin increased.
•
Antihypertensives: enhanced hypotensive effect.
•
Antipsychotics: increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias due to hypokalaemia.
•
Atomoxetine: increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias due to hypokalaemia.
•
Beta-blockers: increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias due to hypokalaemia with sotalol.
•
Cardiac glycosides: increased toxicity if hypokalaemia 
occurs.
•
Ciclosporin: possibly increases ciclosporin 
concentration.
•
Cytotoxics: alkaline urine increases methotrexate 
excretion; increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias 
due to hypokalaemia with arsenic trioxide; increased 
risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity with platinum 
compounds.
•
Lithium: lithium excretion increased.

Metabolism
Acetylcysteine undergoes transformation in the liver, and 
may be present in plasma as the parent compound or 
as various oxidised metabolites such as 
N
-acetylcystine, 
N,N
-diacetylcystine, and cysteine either free or bound 
to plasma proteins. Oral bioavailability is low (4–10%). 
It has been suggested that acetylcysteine's low oral 
bioavailability may be due to metabolism in the gut wall 
and first-pass metabolism in the liver.

Bennett recommends administering 75% of dose for 
patients with severe renal impairment; however, the 
manufacturer does not recommend a dose reduction 
for paracetamol poisoning and, from its records, 
neither does the National Poisons Centre.
•
There is some evidence that acetylcysteine may have 
a renoprotective effect during scans involving the use 
of contrast media, in patients with already impaired 
renal function.
•
Dose = 600 mg PO BD the day before the scan, 
repeated the day of the scan, together with IV or PO 
fluids. Injection may be taken orally, or tablets are 
available from IDIS.

creatinine clearance, indicating that tubular secretion, 
in addition to glomerular filtration, contributes to

•
Monitor aciclovir levels in critically ill patients. 
Reports of neurological toxicity at maximum 
recommended doses.
•
Renal impairment developing during treatment with 
aciclovir usually responds rapidly to rehydration of 
the patient, and/or dosage reduction or withdrawal 
of the drug. Adequate hydration of the patient 
should be maintained.
•
Plasma aciclovir concentration is reduced by 60% 
during haemodialysis.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

cis 
acitretin), which is also a teratogen, by 
glucuronidation and cleavage of the side chain. Acitretin 
is excreted entirely in the form of its metabolites, in

•
Anti-arrhythmics: increased risk of myocardial 
depression.
•
Antipsychotics: increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias with antipsychotics that prolong the QT 
interval.
•
Beta-blockers: increased risk of myocardial 
depression.
•
Effect is enhanced and extended by dipyridamole; 
therefore if use of adenosine is essential, dosage 
should be reduced by a factor of 4 (i.e. initial dosage 
of 0.5–1 mg).
•
Theophylline and other xanthines are potent 
inhibitors of adenosine.

Other information
•
Neither the kidney nor the liver are involved in 
the degradation of exogenous adenosine, so dose 
adjustments are not required in hepatic or renal 
insufficiency.
•
Unlike verapamil, adenosine may be used in 
conjunction with a beta-blocker.
•
Common side effects: facial flushing, chest 
pain, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, nausea and

Metabolism
Most adrenaline that is either injected into the body 
or released into the circulation from the adrenal 
medulla, is very rapidly inactivated by processes that 
include uptake into adrenergic neurones, diffusion, and 
enzymatic degradation in the liver and body tissues by 
catechol-
O
-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine 
oxidase (MAO). In general, adrenaline is methylated 
to metanephrine by COMT followed by oxidative 
deamination by MAO and eventual conversion to 
4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid (formerly termed 
vanillylmandelic acid; VMA), or oxidatively deaminated 
by MAO and converted to 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid 
which, in turn, is methylated by COMT, once again to 
4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid.
The metabolites are excreted in the urine mainly as their 
glucuronide and ethereal sulfate conjugates. Up to 90% of 
an IV dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.

Exposure to afatinib was found to be increased in 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. 
Adjustments to the starting dose are not necessary 
in patients with mild (eGFR=60–89 mL/

) renal impairment. Monitor patients 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR=15–29 mL/

) and adjust dose if not tolerated. 
Treatment in patients with eGFR<15 mL/
min/1.73 m

•
A case report used afatinib in a haemodialysis patient 
initially at a dose of 30 mg for 2 months with good 
effect and tolerability. The dose was then increased 
to 40 mg and after a few days the patient experienced 
significant asthenia, vomiting and nausea. The 
patient stopped therapy.

Metabolism
No metabolism studies have been conducted with

degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids.
Free aflibercept is mainly cleared by binding to 
endogenous VEGF to form a stable, inactive complex. As 
with other large proteins, both free and bound aflibercept, 
are expected to be cleared, more slowly, by other biological 
mechanisms, such as proteolytic catabolism.

•
Patients with severe renal impairment receiving 
albiglutide experienced a higher frequency of 
diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting compared to patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment. This in 
some cases may lead to acute kidney injury.
•
Exposure was increased by approximately 30–40% 
in patients with severe renal impairment compared 
to those with normal renal function. In addition, 
a clinical pharmacology study showed a similar 
increased exposure for patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment or those on haemodialysis 
relative to patients without renal impairment. These 
differences were not considered clinically relevant.
•
A study investigated the pharmacokinetics and 
safety of albiglutide with varying degrees of renal 
impairment and haemodialysis. There was a trend 
for more glycaemic lowering as the eGFR decreased. 
The severe group had a higher frequency of 
gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhoea, constipation, nausea 
and vomiting) and hypoglycaemic (with background 
sulfonylurea use) effects compared with patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment. The advice 
from this study is that it should be used with caution

Metabolism
Alfacalcidol is hydroxylated in the liver by the 
enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase to form the active 
1,25-dihydroxycolecalciferol (calcitriol). Calcitriol is 
inactivated in both the kidney and the intestine, through 
the formation of a number of intermediates including the 
formation of the 1,24,25-trihydroxy derivatives. Vitamin 
D compounds and their metabolites are excreted mainly 
in the bile and faeces with only small amounts appearing 
in urine; there is some enterohepatic recycling but it is 
considered to have a negligible contribution to vitamin D 
status.

Approximately 20% of ingested allopurinol is excreted 
in the faeces. Elimination of allopurinol is mainly 
by metabolic conversion to oxipurinol by xanthine 
oxidase and aldehyde oxidase, with less than 10% of the 
unchanged drug excreted in the urine.
Oxipurinol is a less potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase 
than allopurinol, but the plasma half-life of oxipurinol is 
far more prolonged. Estimates range from 13–30 hours in 
man. Therefore effective inhibition of xanthine oxidase is 
maintained over a 24 hour period with a single daily dose.
Oxipurinol is eliminated unchanged in the urine but has 
a long elimination half-life because it undergoes tubular 
reabsorption.

Metabolism
The major biotransformation route is via monoamine 
oxidase (MAO-A) mediated oxidative deamination to 
the indole acetic metabolite. Cytochrome P450 (3A4 
and 2D6 isozymes) and flavin mono-oxygenase are other 
enzymes involved in the metabolism of almotriptan. 
None of the metabolites are significantly active

Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism. Two 
minor metabolites were detected following administration 
of an oral dose of [
14
C]-alogliptin, N-demethylated 
alogliptin, M-I (<1% of the parent compound), and 
N-acetylated alogliptin, M-II (<6% of the parent 
compound). M-I is an active metabolite and is a highly 
selective inhibitor of DPP-4 similar to alogliptin; M-II 
does not display any inhibitory activity towards DPP-4 
or other DPP-related enzymes. 
In vitro

Aluminum hydroxide or oxide is slowly solubilised in 
the stomach and reacts with hydrochloric acid to form 
aluminium chloride and water. In addition to forming 
aluminium chloride, dihydroxyaluminium sodium 
carbonate and aluminium carbonate form carbon dioxide, 
and aluminium phosphate forms phosphoric acid. About 
17–30% of the aluminium chloride formed is absorbed 
and is rapidly excreted by the kidneys in patients with 
normal renal function.
Aluminium-containing antacids also combine with 
dietary phosphate in the intestine forming insoluble, 
nonabsorbable aluminium phosphate which is excreted in 
the faeces.

Metabolism
Amantadine is metabolised in the liver to a minor extent, 
mainly by N-acetylation. The renal amantadine clearance 
is much higher than the creatinine clearance, suggesting 
renal tubular secretion in addition to glomerular 
filtration. After 4–5 days, 90% of the dose appears 
unchanged in urine. The rate is considerably influenced by 
urinary pH: a rise in pH brings about a fall in excretion.

to form ambrisentan glucuronide (13%). Ambrisentan 
also undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly by CYP3A4

4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan (which has little activity) 
which is further glucuronidated to 4-hydroxymethyl 
ambrisentan glucuronide.

Doses in renal impairment from 
Drug Dosing in 
Renal Insufficiency
, by Seyffart G.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Other information
•
Aminophylline: 80% theophylline + 20% 
ethylenediamine.
•
In bodily fluids, aminophylline rapidly dissociates 
from ethylenediamine and releases free theophylline 
in the body. It is therefore not present in the body 
long enough to be dialysed, whereas theophylline is 
dialysed, see theophylline monograph.
•
Optimum response obtained at plasma theophylline

Amiodarone is metabolised in the liver; the major 
metabolite, desethylamiodarone, also has antiarrhythmic 
properties. There is very little urinary excretion of 
amiodarone or its metabolites, the major route of 
excretion being in faeces via the bile; some enterohepatic

isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 to its 
primary active metabolite, nortriptyline. Other paths 
of metabolism of amitriptyline include hydroxylation 
(possibly to active metabolites) by CYP2D6 and

Metabolism
The metabolic fate of amphotericin B in humans has 
not been fully elucidated. Conventional amphotericin B 
is eliminated very slowly (over weeks to months) by the 
kidneys; slow release of the drug from the peripheral 
compartment may account for the long elimination half-
life. Over a 7-day period, the cumulative urinary excretion 
of a single dose of conventional amphotericin B is about 
40% of the administered drug. It has been estimated 
that only about 2–5% of a total dose of amphotericin B 
is excreted in urine unchanged. When conventional IV 
amphotericin B therapy is discontinued, the drug can be 
detected in blood for up to 4 weeks and in urine for up to 
4–8 weeks.
Abelcet is Amphotericin B complexed to 
phospholipids; the pharmacokinetic properties 
of Abelcet and conventional amphotericin B are 
different. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that, after 
administration of Abelcet, amphotericin B levels were 
highest in the liver, spleen and lung.

AmBisome has a significantly different pharmacokinetic 
profile from that reported in the literature for 
conventional presentations of amphotericin B, with 
higher amphotericin B plasma concentrations (C
max
) and 
increased exposure (AUC
0-24
). Due to the size of the 
liposomes, there is no glomerular filtration and renal 
elimination of AmBisome, thus avoiding interaction of 
amphotericin B with the cells of the distal tubuli and 
reducing the potential for nephrotoxicity seen with 
conventional amphotericin B presentations.

Metabolism
The metabolic fate of amphotericin B in humans has 
not been fully elucidated. Conventional amphotericin B 
is eliminated very slowly (over weeks to months) by the 
kidneys; slow release of the drug from the peripheral 
compartment may account for the long elimination half-
life. Over a 7-day period, the cumulative urinary excretion 
of a single dose of conventional amphotericin B is about 
40% of the administered drug. It has been estimated 
that only about 2–5% of a total dose of amphotericin B 
is excreted in urine unchanged. When conventional IV 
amphotericin B therapy is discontinued, the drug can be 
detected in blood for up to 4 weeks and in urine for up to 
4–8 weeks.

Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular 
filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by 
probenecid. About 20–40% of an oral dose and 60–80% 
of an IV dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine 
in 6 hours. High concentrations are reached in bile; it

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Hepatic metabolism of anidulafungin has not been 
observed. Anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant 
substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes.
Anidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation at 
physiologic temperature and pH to a ring-opened peptide 
that lacks antifungal activity. The ring-opened product 
is subsequently converted to peptidic degradants and 
eliminated mainly through biliary excretion.
In a single-dose clinical study, radiolabelled 
[
14
C]-anidulafungin (~88 mg) was administered to 
healthy subjects. Approximately 30% of the administered 
radioactive dose was eliminated in the faeces over 9 days, 
of which less than 10% was intact drug. Less than 1% 
of the administered radioactive dose was excreted in the 
urine, indicating negligible renal clearance.

14
C]fosaprepitant, a prodrug for 
aprepitant, aprepitant accounts for approximately 19% of 
the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours. 12 metabolites 
of aprepitant have been identified in human plasma. The 
metabolism of aprepitant, primarily by CYP3A4 and 
potentially with minor contribution by CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C19, occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine 
ring and its side chains and the resultant metabolites were 
only weakly active.
Aprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. 
Metabolites are excreted in urine (57%) and via biliary 
excretion in faeces (45%).

Metabolism
The metabolism of argatroban has not yet been fully

M-3) are formed by hydroxylation and aromatisation 
of the 3-methyltetrahydroquinoline ring in the liver. 
The main metabolite (M1) exerts 40-fold weaker 
antithrombin effect than argatroban. Metabolites M-1, 
M-2 and M-3 were detected in the urine, and M-1 was 
detected in plasma and faeces.
Argatroban is excreted mainly in the faeces, presumably 
through biliary secretion. Following intravenous infusion 
of [

Metabolism
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver 
primarily by three biotransformation pathways: 
dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. 
Based on 
in vitro
 studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 
enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and 
hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is 
catalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the main active 
moiety in systemic circulation. At steady state, dehydro-
aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% 
of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Following a single oral dose of [
14
C]-aripiprazole, 
approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity 
was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in 
the faeces. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole

Metabolism
When placed into solution, arsenic trioxide immediately 
forms the hydrolysis product arsenious acid (As
III
), which 
is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic trioxide.
The metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of 
As
III
 to arsenic acid (As
V
), as well as oxidative methylation 
to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA
V
) and dimethylarsinic 
acid (DMA
V
) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver.
Approximately 15% of the administered arsenic trioxide 
dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged As
III
. The 
methylated metabolites of As
III
 (MMA
V
, DMA
V
) are 
primarily excreted in the urine.

in the stomach and intestine. Some aspirin is hydrolysed 
to salicylate in the gut wall. Once absorbed, aspirin is 
rapidly converted to salicylate, but during the first 20 
minutes after an oral dose aspirin is the main form of 
the drug in the plasma. Both aspirin and salicylate have 
pharmacological activity although only aspirin has an 
anti-platelet effect. Salicylate is extensively bound to 
plasma proteins and is rapidly distributed to all body 
parts.
Salicylate is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism; 
the metabolites include salicyluric acid, salicyl phenolic 
glucuronide, salicylic acyl glucuronide, gentisic acid, and 
gentisuric acid. The formation of the major metabolites, 
salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide, is easily 
saturated and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. As 
a result, steady-state plasma-salicylate concentrations 
increase disproportionately with dose. Salicylate is also 
excreted unchanged in the urine; the amount excreted by 
this route increases with increasing dose and also depends 
on urinary pH, about 30% of a dose being excreted in 
alkaline urine compared with 2% of a dose in acidic urine. 
Renal excretion involves glomerular filtration, active renal 
tubular secretion, and passive tubular reabsorption.

Metabolism
Atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 
isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are 
then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated 
metabolites. Additional minor metabolic pathways consist 
of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites 
of atazanavir in plasma have been characterised. Neither 
metabolite demonstrated 
in vitro
 antiviral activity.
Following a single 400 mg dose of [
14
C]-atazanavir, 79% 
and 13% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the 
faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted 
for approximately 20% and 7% of the administered dose

Total rabbit IgG remains detectable in 81% of patients at 
2 months. Active ATG (that is IgG which is available to 
bind to human lymphocytes and which causes the desired 
immunological effects) disappears from the circulation 
faster, with only 12% of patients having detectable active 
ATG levels at day 90.
Significant immunisation against rabbit IgG is observed 
in about 40% of patients. In most cases, immunisation 
develops within the first 15 days of treatment initiation. 
Patients presenting with immunisation show a faster

Atorvastatin undergoes extensive presystemic clearance 
in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass 
metabolism. Atorvastatin is metabolised by cytochrome 
P450 3A4 to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives 
and various beta-oxidation products. These products are 
further metabolised via glucuronidation. Approximately 
70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA 
reductase is attributed to active metabolites.
Atorvastatin is eliminated primarily in bile as active 
metabolites following hepatic and/or extrahepatic 
metabolism, but does not appear to undergo significant

Metabolism
Azathioprine is extensively metabolised to its active moiety 
mercaptopurine, which in turn is activated intracellularly 
by conversion to nucleotide derivatives. Mercaptopurine 
is rapidly and extensively metabolised in the liver, by 
methylation, oxidation and by the formation of inorganic 
sulfates. Thiol methylation is catalysed by the enzyme 
thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity is 
highly variable in patients because of a genetic polymorphism 
in the TPMT gene. About 10% of a dose of azathioprine is 
reported to be split between the sulfur and the purine ring 
to give 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-thioimidazole. The proportion of 
different metabolites is reported to vary between patients.
Metabolites and small amounts of unchanged azathioprine 
and mercaptopurine are eliminated in the urine.

In pharmacokinetic studies it has been demonstrated that 
the concentrations of azithromycin measured in tissues 
are noticeably higher (as much as 50 times) than those 
measured in plasma, which indicates that the agent strongly 
binds to tissues. Azithromycin is excreted in bile mainly as 
unchanged drug. Ten metabolites have also been detected in 
bile, which are formed through N- and O- demethylation 
in the liver, hydroxylation of desosamine – and aglycone 
rings and cleavage of cladinose conjugate. The metabolites 
of azithromycin are not microbiologically active.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
A
106
Aztreonam
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

those in the plasma. Baclofen is metabolised to only a 
minor extent. Deamination yields the main metabolite, 
β
-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutyric acid, which is

Very little of an oral dose of balsalazide is absorbed 
via the upper gastrointestinal tract, and almost the 
entire dose reaches its site of action in the colon intact. 
It is broken down by the colonic bacterial flora into 
5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine), which is active, and 
4-aminobenzoylalanine, which is considered to be an 
inert carrier. Most of a dose is eliminated via the faeces, 
but about 25% of the released mesalazine is absorbed and 
acetylated. A small proportion of 4-aminobenzoylalanine 
is absorbed and acetylated by first-pass metabolism 
through the liver. The acetylated metabolites are excreted

Metabolism
Baricitinib is hepatically metabolism by CYP3A4, <10% 
of the dose identified as undergoing biotransformation. 
No metabolites were detected in plasma.
In a clinical pharmacology study, baricitinib was excreted 
mainly as the unchanged active substance in urine (69%) 
and faeces (15%) and only 4 minor oxidative metabolites 
were identified (3 in urine; 1 in faeces) constituting 
approximately 5% and 1% of the dose, respectively.

) 
and substantial persistent albuminuria (>300 mg/
day) who were already treated with RAAS-inhibiting 
agents. Participants received placebo or baricitinib 
at low-to-high daily doses (0.75 mg, 1.5 mg in single 
or divided dose, 4 mg) for 24 weeks, followed by 
a 4-week wash-out period. Baricitinib treatment 
resulted in a reduction in albuminuria at both 3 
and 6 months. At 6 months, there was a statistically 
significant decrease in haemoglobin compared to 
placebo in the high-dose baricitinib group. This 
reduction was not unexpected in the higher dose 
range since erythropoietin signalling is dependent on 
JAK2 activation. More trials are being done looking

During clinical development belimumab was studied 
in patients with SLE and renal impairment (261 
subjects with moderate renal impairment, creatinine 
clearance ≥30 and <60 mL/min; 14 subjects with 
severe renal impairment, creatinine clearance ≥15 
and <30 mL/min). The reduction in systemic 
clearances were 1.4% for mild (75 mL/min), 11.7% 
for moderate (45 mL/min) and 24% for severe (22.5 
mL/min) renal impairment. Although proteinuria 
(≥2 g/day) increased belimumab clearance 
and decreases in creatinine clearance decreased 
belimumab clearance, these effects were within the 
expected range of variability. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients with renal 
impairment.

Benzylpenicillin is metabolised to a limited extent and the 
penicilloic acid derivative has been recovered in the urine. 
Benzylpenicillin is rapidly excreted in the urine; about 
20% of an oral dose appears unchanged in the urine; about 
60–90% of an IM dose of benzylpenicillin undergoes 
renal elimination, 10% by glomerular filtration and 90% by 
tubular secretion, mainly within the first hour. 
Significant concentrations occur in bile, but in patients 
with normal renal function only small amounts are 
excreted via the bile. 
Renal tubular secretion is inhibited by probenecid, which 
can be given to increase plasma-penicillin concentrations 
and prolong half-life.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: The 
patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ within 
the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid going through 
the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, dialysate fluid 
and replacement fluid and dividing it by 60, which gives 
a value in mL /minute, equated to a patient GFR. E.g. 
blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, filtration fluid flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, 
replacement rate (post filter) = 200 mL/hr – this gives 
a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/hr. This is then divided by 
60 to give an approximate GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose 
would then be according to the GFR rather than using 
the dialysis recommendations.

Metabolism
Corticosteroids are metabolised mainly in the liver 
but also in other tissues, and are excreted in the urine. 
The slower metabolism of the synthetic corticosteroids 
with their lower protein-binding affinity may account 
for their increased potency compared with the natural 
corticosteroids.

Betaxolol is highly lipophilic which results in good 
permeation of the cornea, allowing high intraocular levels 
of the drug. The elimination of betaxolol is primarily by 
the renal rather than faecal route. The major metabolic 
pathways yield two carboxylic acid forms plus unchanged 
betaxolol in the urine (approximately 16% of the

Metabolism
Assessment of bevacizumab metabolism in rabbits 
following a single IV dose of 
125
I-bevacizumab indicated 
that its metabolic profile was similar to that expected for 
a native IgG molecule which does not bind VEGF. The 
metabolism and elimination of bevacizumab is similar to 
endogenous IgG i.e. primarily via proteolytic catabolism 
throughout the body, including endothelial cells, and does 
not rely primarily on elimination through the kidneys and 
liver. Binding of the IgG to the FcRn receptor results in 
protection from cellular metabolism and the long terminal 
half-life.

•
No formal studies have been conducted in patients 
with renal insufficiency. Clinical pharmacokinetic 
data indicate that urinary elimination of bexarotene 
and its metabolites is a minor excretory pathway for 
bexarotene. In all evaluated patients, the estimated 
renal clearance of bexarotene was less than 1 mL/
minute. In view of the limited data, patients with 
renal insufficiency should be monitored carefully 
while on Targretin capsule therapy.

The (S)-enantiomer is rapidly cleared relative to

half-life of about 1 week.
On daily administration of bicalutamide 150 mg, the 
(R)-enantiomer accumulates about 10-fold in plasma as a 
consequence of its long half-life.
At steady state, the predominantly active (R)-enantiomer 
accounts for 99% of the total circulating enantiomers. 
Bicalutamide is highly protein bound (racemate 96%, 
(R)-enantiomer >99%) and extensively metabolised 
(oxidation and glucuronidation); its metabolites are 
eliminated via the kidneys and bile in approximately equal 
proportions.

average of 10.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine 
as BHPM glucuronide. Following the administration as a

As a peptide, bivalirudin is expected to undergo catabolism 
to its constituent amino acids, with subsequent recycling of 
the amino acid in the body pool. Bivalirudin is metabolised 
by proteases, including thrombin. The primary metabolite 
resulting from the cleavage of Arg
3
-Pro
4
 bond of the 
N-terminal sequence by thrombin is not active because of 
the loss of affinity to the catalytic active site of thrombin.

Metabolism
The mechanism for bio-transformation is not yet fully 
known. Inactivation takes place during enzymatic 
breakdown by bleomycin hydrolase, primarily in plasma, 
liver and other organs and, to a much lesser degree, in skin 
and lungs.
About 60-70% of the administered drug is excreted 
unchanged in the urine, probably by glomerular filtration. 
Approximately 50% is recovered in the urine in the 
24 hours following an IV or IM injection. The rate of 
excretion, therefore, is highly influenced by renal function; 
concentrations in plasma are greatly elevated if usual 
doses are given to patients with renal impairment with 
only up to 20% excreted in 24 hours.

metabolites that are inactive against HCV. After a single 
800 mg oral dose of 
14
C-boceprevir, the most abundant 
circulating metabolites were a diasteriomeric mixture 
of ketone-reduced metabolites with a mean exposure 
approximately 4-fold greater than that of boceprevir. 
Boceprevir also undergoes, to a lesser extent, oxidative 
metabolism mediated by CYP3A4/5.
Mainly excreted by the liver – approximately 79% and 9% 
of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively,

Metabolism
Upon multiple dosing, plasma concentrations of bosentan 
decrease gradually to 50%–65% of those seen after single 
dose administration. This decrease is probably due to 
auto-induction of metabolising liver enzymes. Steady-
state conditions are reached within 3–5 days.
Bosentan is eliminated by biliary excretion following 
metabolism in the liver by the cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Bosentan 
forms three metabolites and only one of these is 
pharmacologically active. This metabolite is mainly 
excreted unchanged via the bile. In adult patients, the 
exposure to the active metabolite is greater than in healthy 
subjects. In patients with evidence of the presence of 
cholestasis, the exposure to the active metabolite may be 
increased.

A study in subjects with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m² and 
not requiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma 
AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased 
(+21%) relative to healthy controls, while the AUC 
of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites 
were increased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The 
renal clearance of these non-active metabolites was 
decreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did 
not reveal any safety concerns in non-clinical studies.
•
Oral bioavailability is approximately 100%.

Metabolism
Elimination of buprenorphine is bi- or triphasic; 
metabolism takes place in the liver by oxidation 
via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 
to the pharmacologically active metabolite 
N
-dealkylbuprenorphine (norbuprenorphine), and by 
conjugation to glucuronide metabolites. Buprenorphine 
is subject to considerable first-pass metabolism after 
oral doses. However, when given by the usual routes 
buprenorphine is excreted mainly unchanged in 
the faeces; there is some evidence for enterohepatic 
recirculation. Metabolites are excreted in the urine, but 
very little unchanged drug is excreted in this way.

plasma concentrations, than the parent compound. 
Hydroxybupropion is the major metabolite, produced 
by the metabolism of bupropion by the cytochrome 
P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6; in animal studies 
hydroxybupropion was one-half as potent as bupropion. 
Threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion 
are produced by reduction and are about one-fifth the

Metabolism
Systemic bioavailability of buspirone is low because of 
extensive first-pass metabolism. Metabolism in the liver is 
extensive via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4; 
hydroxylation yields several inactive metabolites and 
oxidative dealkylation produces 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-
piperazine, which is reported to be about 25% as potent 
as the parent drug in one model of anxiolytic activity.
Buspirone is excreted mainly as metabolites in the urine, 
and also the faeces.

Metabolism
Animal studies have shown that calcitonin is primarily 
metabolised via proteolysis in the kidney following 
parenteral administration. The metabolites lack the 
specific biological activity of calcitonin.
Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusively 
degraded in the kidneys, forming pharmacologically 
inactive fragments of the molecule. Therefore, the 
metabolic clearance is much lower in patients with ESRD 
than in healthy subjects. However, the clinical relevance of 
this finding is not known.

Metabolism
During transport in the blood at physiological 
concentrations, calcitriol is mostly bound to a specific 
vitamin D binding protein (DBP), but also, to a lesser 
degree, to lipoproteins and albumin. At higher blood 
calcitriol concentrations, DBP appears to become 
saturated, and increased binding to lipoproteins and 
albumin occurs.
Calcitriol is inactivated in both the kidney and 
the intestine, through the formation of a number 
of intermediates including the formation of the 
1,24,25-trihydroxy derivatives. It is excreted in the bile 
and faeces and is subject to enterohepatic circulation.

Metabolism
The residual acetate will be metabolised through 
bicarbonate, which will be further excreted via normal 
metabolic routes.
Any unbound calcium not involved in the binding 
of phosphate will be variable and may be absorbed. 
Calcium is absorbed mainly from the small intestine by 
active transport and passive diffusion. About one-third 
of ingested calcium is absorbed although this can vary 
depending upon dietary factors and the state of the small 
intestine. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), a 
metabolite of vitamin D, enhances the active phase of 
absorption.
Excess calcium is mainly excreted renally. Unabsorbed 
calcium is eliminated in the faeces, together with that 
secreted in the bile and pancreatic juice. Minor amounts 
are lost in the sweat, skin, hair, and nails.

Metabolism
Capecitabine is a prodrug. It is hydrolysed in the liver 
to 5
′
-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5
′
-DFCR), which is then 
converted to 5
′
-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5
′
-DFUR) and 
subsequently to the active 5-fluorouracil in body tissues, 
via the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase. 5-Fluorouracil 
is further metabolised to 5-fluorouridine monophosphate 
and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate.
About 15% of 5-fluorouracil is excreted unchanged in the 
urine within 6 hours. The remainder is inactivated mainly 
in the liver and is catabolised via dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase. A large amount is excreted as respiratory 
carbon dioxide; urea and other metabolites are also 
produced. About 3% of a dose of capecitabine is excreted 
in the urine unchanged.

Metabolism
About half the absorbed dose of captopril is rapidly 
metabolised, mainly to captopril-cysteine disulfide and 
the disulfide dimer of captopril. 
In vitro
 studies suggest 
that captopril and its metabolites may undergo reversible 
interconversions. It has been suggested that the drug may 
be more extensively metabolised in patients with renal 
impairment than in patients with normal renal function.
Captopril and its metabolites are excreted in urine. Renal 
excretion of unchanged captopril occurs principally via 
tubular secretion. In patients with normal renal function, 
more than 95% of an absorbed dose is excreted in urine 
in 24 hours; about 40–50% of the drug excreted in urine 
is unchanged captopril and the remainder is mainly 
the disulfide dimer of captopril and captopril-cysteine 
disulfide. In one study in healthy individuals, about 20% 
of a single dose of captopril was recovered in faeces in 5 
days, apparently representing unabsorbed drug.

Metabolism
Carbamazepine is metabolised in the liver by 
cytochrome P450 3A4, where the epoxide pathway 
of biotransformation yields the 10, 11-transdiol 
derivative and its glucuronide as the main metabolites. 
9-Hydroxy-methyl-10-carbamoyl acridan is a minor 
metabolite related to this pathway. Other important 
biotransformation pathways for carbamazepine lead to 
various monohydroxylated compounds, as well as to the 
N-glucuronide of carbamazepine produced by UGT2B7.
After administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg 
carbamazepine, 72% is excreted in the urine and 28% in 
the faeces. In the urine, about 2% of the dose is recovered 
as unchanged drug and about 1% as the pharmacologically 
active 10,11-epoxide metabolite.

Metabolism
Intravenous carmustine is rapidly metabolised, and no 
intact drug is detectable after 15 minutes. It is partially 
metabolised to active metabolites by liver microsomal 
enzymes, which have a long half-life. It is thought that the 
antineoplastic activity may be due to metabolites.
Approximately 30% of a dose is excreted in the urine after 
24 hours, and 60–70% of the total dose after 96 hours. 
About 10% is excreted as respiratory CO

. Terminal half-

Metabolism
Plasma concentrations of caspofungin decline in a 
polyphasic manner after intravenous infusion. The 
initial short 
α
-phase occurs immediately post-infusion 
and is followed by a 
β
-phase with a half-life of 9–11 
hours; an additional longer 
γ
-phase also occurs with a 
half-life of 40–50 hours. Plasma clearance is dependent 
on distribution rather than on biotransformation 
or excretion. Caspofungin undergoes spontaneous 
degradation to an open ring compound. There is further 
slow metabolism of caspofungin by hydrolysis and 
N
-acetylation and excretion in faeces and urine.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be

Metabolism
Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is converted into the active 
ceftaroline in plasma by phosphatase enzymes. Hydrolysis 
of the beta-lactam ring of ceftaroline occurs to form 
the microbiologically inactive, open-ring metabolite, 
ceftaroline M-1.
Ceftaroline is mainly eliminated by the kidneys. Renal 
clearance is approximately equal, or slightly lower than 
the glomerular filtration rate in the kidney, and 
in vitro
transporter studies indicate that active secretion does not 
contribute to the renal elimination of ceftaroline.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Ceftazidime is passively excreted in bile, although only 
a small proportion (1%) is eliminated by this route. It 
is mainly excreted by the kidneys, almost exclusively by 
glomerular filtration; probenecid has little effect on the 
excretion. About 80–90% of a dose appears unchanged in 
the urine within 24 hours.

Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium is the pro-drug of 
the active moiety ceftobiprole. Conversion from the 
prodrug ceftobiprole medocaril sodium, to the active 
moiety ceftobiprole, occurs rapidly and is mediated by 
non-specific plasma esterases. Ceftobiprole undergoes 
minimal metabolism to the open-ring metabolite, which is 
microbiologically inactive.

Metabolism
Chlorpromazine is subject to considerable first-pass 
metabolism in the gut wall and is also extensively 
metabolised in the liver. Paths of metabolism of 
chlorpromazine include hydroxylation and conjugation 
with glucuronic acid, 
N-
oxidation, oxidation of a sulfur 
atom, and dealkylation.
Chlorpromazine is excreted in the urine and bile in the 
form of both active and inactive metabolites; there is some 
evidence of enterohepatic recycling.

Ciclosporin is widely distributed throughout the body. 
Distribution in the blood is concentration-dependent, 
with between 41–58% in erythrocytes and 10–20% in 
leucocytes; the remainder is found in plasma, about 90% 
protein-bound, mostly to lipoprotein.
Clearance from the blood is biphasic. Ciclosporin is 
extensively metabolised in the liver and mainly excreted 
in faeces via the bile. About 6% of a dose is reported to be 
excreted in the urine, less than 0.1% unchanged.

Metabolism
After IV doses of cidofovir, serum concentrations decline 
with a reported terminal half-life of about 2.2 hours (the 
intracellular half-life of the active diphosphate may be up 
to 65 hours).
Cidofovir is eliminated mainly by renal excretion, both 
by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 
80–100% of a dose is recovered unchanged from the urine 
within 24 hours. Use with probenecid may reduce the 
excretion of cidofovir to some extent by blocking tubular 
secretion, although 70–85% has still been reported to be 
excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.

There are two major metabolites, a dehydro-
cilostazol and a 4'-trans-hydroxy cilostazol, both of 
which have similar apparent half-lives. The dehydro 
metabolite is 4–7 times as active a platelet anti-
aggregant as the parent compound, and the 4'-trans-
hydroxy metabolite is one fifth as active.
•
In subjects with severe renal impairment, the free 
fraction of cilostazol was 27% higher and both C
max
and AUC were 29% and 39% lower respectively than 
in subjects with normal renal function. The C
max
 and 
AUC of the dehydro metabolite were 41% and 47% 
lower respectively in the severely renally impaired 
subjects compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. The C
max
 and AUC of 4'-trans-hydroxy 
cilostazol were 173% and 209% greater in subjects 
with severe renal impairment. The drug should be 
used with great caution if administered to patients 
with a creatinine clearance <25 mL/min.

Metabolism
The bioavailability of cimetidine after oral doses is about 
60–70%, due to hepatic first-pass metabolism. Cimetidine 
is partially metabolised in the liver to the sulfoxide and to 
hydroxymethylcimetidine. About 50% of an oral dose, and 
75% of an intravenous dose, is excreted unchanged in the 
urine in 24 hours. After an oral or parenteral dose of 300 
mg, blood concentrations remain above that required to 
provide 80% inhibition of basal gastric acid secretion for 
4–5 hours.

Metabolism
Ciprofloxacin is eliminated principally by urinary 
excretion, but non-renal clearance may account for about 
one-third of elimination and includes hepatic metabolism, 
biliary excretion, and possibly transluminal secretion 
across the intestinal mucosa. At least 4 active metabolites 
have been identified. Oxociprofloxacin appears to be 
the major urinary metabolite and sulfociprofloxacin the 
primary faecal metabolite.
Urinary excretion is by active tubular secretion as well 
as glomerular filtration and is reduced by probenecid; 
it is virtually complete within 24 hours. About 40–50% 
of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and 
about 15% as metabolites. Up to 70% of a parenteral dose 
may be excreted unchanged within 24 hours and 10% as 
metabolites. Faecal excretion over 5 days has accounted 
for 20–35% of an oral dose and 15% of an intravenous 
dose.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Cisplatin is non-enzymatically transformed into multiple 
metabolites. More than 90% of the platinum from a dose 
is protein bound within 2–4 hours; only the unbound 
fraction has significant antineoplastic activity. There is 
good uptake of cisplatin in the kidneys, liver and intestine. 
It also distributes into third spaces such as ascites and 
pleural fluid.
Excretion of intact drug and metabolites is mainly in the 
urine but is incomplete and prolonged: up to about 50% 
of a dose has been reported to be excreted in urine over 5 
days, and platinum may be detected in tissue for several 
months afterwards. The unbound fraction, which is 
more rapidly cleared (20–80% within 24 hours), may be 
actively secreted by the renal tubules.

Citalopram is metabolised by demethylation, 
deamination, and oxidation to active and inactive 
metabolites. The demethylation of citalopram to one of 
its active metabolites, demethylcitalopram, involves the 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; 
the metabolism of citalopram is also partly dependent on 
CYP2D6. Didemethylcitalopram has also been identified 
as a metabolite of citalopram.
It is excreted mainly via the liver (85%) with the 
remainder via the kidneys. About 12% is excreted in the 
urine as unchanged drug.

Metabolism
Cladribine is extensively distributed and penetrates into 
the CNS. Cladribine is phosphorylated within cells by 
deoxycytidine kinase to form 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-
5
′
-monophosphate which is further phosphorylated to 
the diphosphate by nucleoside monophosphate kinase 
and to the active metabolite 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5
′
-
triphosphate (CdATP) by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. 
CdATP inhibits DNA synthesis and repair, particularly 
in lymphocytes and monocytes.
There is little information available on the route of 
excretion of cladribine in man. An average of 18% of 
the administered dose has been reported to be excreted 
in urine of patients with solid tumours during a 5-day 
continuous intravenous infusion.

14-hydroxyclarithromycin is formed by first pass 
metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin are non 
linear. At 250 mg bd, 15–20% of unchanged drug is excreted 
in the urine. With 500 mg bd dosing urinary excretion is 
approximately 36%. The 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is the 
major urinary metabolite and accounts for 10–15% of the 
dose. Most of the remainder of the dose is eliminated in the 
faeces, primarily via the bile. 5–10% of the parent drug is 
recovered from the faeces.

Add 10 mL water for injection to vial (500 mg). Add 
reconstituted product to 250 mL glucose 5% or sodium 
chloride 0.9%. (Stable in 100 mL, but more likely to cause 
phlebitis, pain and inflammation at the injection site.)
Route
IV infusion into one of the larger proximal veins.
Not to be administered by bolus or IM injection.
Rate of administration
Over 60 minutes.
Other information
•
Use with caution in renal or hepatic failure.
•
Oral bioavailability is 55%.
•
Patients with GFR<10 mL/min, vomiting may be a 
problem with high doses.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: The 
patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ within 
the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid going through 
the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, dialysate fluid 
and replacement fluid and dividing it by 60, which gives 
a value in mL /minute, equated to a patient GFR. E.g. 
blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, filtration fluid flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, 
replacement rate (post filter) = 200 mL/hr – this gives 
a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/hr. This is then divided by 
60 to give an approximate GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose 
would then be according to the GFR rather than using 
the dialysis recommendations.

Clobazam is metabolised in the liver by demethylation 
and hydroxylation; the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
CYP2C19 plays a role in its metabolism. Unlike the 
1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, clobazam, a 
1,5-benzodiazepine, is hydroxylated at the 4-position 
rather than the 3-position.

Metabolism
Because of its lipophilic nature, clofazimine is mainly 
distributed to fatty tissue and reticuloendothelial cells, 
including macrophages. Clofazimine accumulates in the 
body and is largely excreted unchanged in the faeces, 
both as unabsorbed drug and via biliary excretion. About 
1% of the dose is excreted in 24 hours in the urine as 
unchanged clofazimine and metabolites. A small amount 
of clofazimine is also excreted through sebaceous and 
sweat glands, and in sputum.

Clomipramine is extensively demethylated during 
first-pass metabolism in the liver to its primary active 
metabolite, desmethylclomipramine. Clomipramine has 
been estimated to have a plasma elimination half-life of 
about 21 hours; that of desmethylclomipramine is longer 
(about 36 hours).
Paths of metabolism of both clomipramine and 
desmethylclomipramine include hydroxylation and 
N

CSM has advised that cholestatic jaundice may 
occur if treatment exceeds a period of 14 days or up 
to 6 weeks after treatment has been stopped. The 
incidence of cholestatic jaundice occurring with 
co-amoxiclav is higher in males than in females, and 
prevalent particularly in men over the age of 65 years.
 C 
238
Co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin / clavulanic acid)
•
The probability of co-amoxiclav associated 
cholestatic jaundice is 6 times more common than 
with amoxicillin, and with higher doses of clavulanic 
acid.
•
Doses in renal impairment are taken from personal 
experience. 
•
Each 1.2 g vial contains: sodium 2.7 mmol, 
potassium 1 mmol.
•
In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil, 
reduction in pre-dose concentration of the 
active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA) of 
approximately 50% has been reported after starting 
oral co-amoxiclav. The change in pre-dose level 
may not accurately represent changes in overall 
MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose 
of mycophenolate mofetil should not normally be 
necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft 
dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring 
should be performed during the combination and 
shortly after antibiotic treatment.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Levodopa is rapidly decarboxylated by the enzyme

liver, and kidney, to dopamine, which is metabolised 
in turn, principally to dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Other routes 
of metabolism include 
O
-methylation, transamination, 
and oxidation, producing a variety of minor metabolites 
including noradrenaline and 3-
O
-methyldopa; the latter 
may accumulate in the CNS due to its relatively long 
half-life.
About 80% of an oral dose of levodopa is excreted in the 
urine within 24 hours, mainly as dihydroxyphenylacetic 
and homovanillic acids. Only small amounts of levodopa 
are excreted unchanged in the faeces.
Benserazide is rapidly excreted in the urine in the form 
of metabolites, mostly within the first 6 hours; 85% of 
urinary excretion occurrs within 12 hours. It is mainly 
metabolised in the gut and appears to protect levodopa 
against decarboxylation primarily in the gut, but also 
in the rest of the body, mainly by way of its metabolite 
trihydroxybenzylhydrazine.

Paracetamol is metabolised mainly in the liver and 
excreted in the urine mainly as the glucuronide and sulfate 
conjugates. A minor hydroxylated metabolite (
N
-acetyl-
p
-benzoquinoneimine), is usually produced in very small 
amounts by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (mainly CYP2E1 
and CYP3A4) in the liver and kidney. It is usually detoxified 
by conjugation with glutathione but may accumulate after 
paracetamol overdosage and cause tissue damage.
Codeine is metabolised by 
O
- and 
N
-demethylation in 
the liver to morphine, norcodeine, and other metabolites 
including normorphine and hydrocodone. Metabolism to 
morphine is mediated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
CYP2D6, which shows genetic polymorphism. Codeine 
and its metabolites are excreted almost entirely by the 
kidney, mainly as conjugates with glucuronic acid.

Metabolism
Paracetamol is metabolised mainly in the liver and 
excreted in the urine mainly as the glucuronide and 
sulfate conjugates. A minor hydroxylated metabolite 
(
N
-acetyl-
p
-benzoquinoneimine), is usually produced 
in very small amounts by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
(mainly CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) in the liver and kidney. 
It is usually detoxified by conjugation with glutathione 
but may accumulate after paracetamol overdosage and 
cause tissue damage.
Dihydrocodeine is metabolised in the liver via 
the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6, to 
dihydromorphine, which has potent analgesic activity, 
although the analgesic effect of dihydrocodeine appears 
to be mainly due to the parent compound; some is 
also converted via CYP3A4 to nordihydrocodeine. 
Dihydrocodeine is excreted in urine as unchanged drug 
and metabolites, including glucuronide conjugates.

Metabolism
Sulfamethoxazole undergoes conjugation mainly in the 
liver, chiefly to the inactive 
N
4
-acetyl derivative; this 
metabolite represents about 15% of the total amount of 
sulfamethoxazole in the blood. Metabolism is increased 
in patients with renal impairment and decreased in those 
with hepatic impairment. Elimination in the urine is 
dependent on pH. About 80–100% of a dose is excreted 
in the urine, of which about 60% is in the form of the 
acetyl derivative, with the remainder as unchanged drug 
and glucuronide.
Trimethoprim is excreted mainly by the kidneys through 
glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 
10–20% of trimethoprim is metabolised in the liver and 
small amounts are excreted in the faeces via the bile, 
but most, about 40–60% of a dose, is excreted in urine, 
mainly as unchanged drug, within 24 hours.

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
The absorption of colchicine from the gastrointestinal 
tract is thought to be limited by its expulsion by 
P-glycoprotein, for which colchicine is a substrate. 
It is demethylated in the liver via the cytochrome 
P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 to 2 primary metabolites, 
2-
O
-demethylcolchicine and 3-
O
-demethylcolchicine 
(2-DMC and 3-DMC, respectively), and 1 minor 
metabolite, 10-
O
-demethylcolchicine (also known as 
colchiceine). Enterohepatic recycling occurs.
The main route of elimination is hepatobiliary excretion 
in the faeces. Renal excretion accounts for 10–20% of 
colchicine elimination in patients with normal renal 
function.

Studies on the gastrointestinal absorption of colistin have 
shown no significant systemic absorption following oral 
administration.
Colistimethate sodium is converted to the colistin base by 
hydrolysis 
in-vivo
. As 80% of the dose can be recovered 
unchanged in the urine, and there is no biliary excretion, 
it can be assumed that the remaining drug is inactivated in 
the tissues. The mechanism is unknown.

Metabolism
Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug and undergoes 
activation by various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
(notably CYP2B6) in the liver (great inter-patient 
variability in metabolism). The initial metabolites are 
4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and its acyclic tautomer, 
aldophosphamide, which both undergo further 
metabolism; aldophosphamide may undergo non-
enzymatic conversion to active phosphoramide mustard. 
Acrolein is also produced and may be responsible for 
bladder toxicity.
Cyclophosphamide is excreted principally in urine, as 
metabolites and some unchanged drug.

Cyclophosphamide
•
Cyclophosphamide and its alkylating metabolites can 
be eliminated by dialysis.
•
Patients receiving chronic indefinite therapy may be 
at increased risk of developing urothelial carcinoma.
•
If patient is anuric and on dialysis, neither 
cyclophosphamide or its metabolites, nor Mesna 
should appear in the urinary tract. The use of Mesna 
may therefore be unnecessary, although this would be 
a clinical decision.
•
If the patient is still passing urine, Mesna should be 
given to prevent urothelial toxicity.

CSM has advised that in view of the hepatotoxicity 
associated with long-term doses of 300 mg daily, the 
use of cyproterone acetate in prostatic cancer should 
be restricted to short courses, to cover testosterone

Rate of administration
•
IV injection: rapid
•
IV infusion: 1–24 hours
Comments
•
Patients generally tolerate higher doses when 
medication given by rapid IV injection (compared 
with slow infusion), due to the rapid metabolism 
of cytarabine and the consequent short duration of 
action of the high dose.
Other information
•
Elevated baseline serum creatinine (>1.2 mg/dl) 
is an independent risk factor for the development 
of neurotoxicity during treatment with high-dose 
cytarabine. 
•
Retrospective analysis implicates impaired renal 
function as an independent risk factor for high-dose 
cytarabine-induced cerebral and cerebellar toxicity. 
•
The incidence of neurotoxicity was 86–100% 
following administration of high-dose cytarabine 
to patients with CRCL<40 mL/min and 60–76% 
following administration to patients with CRCL<60 
mL/min. In contrast, when patients with CRCL>60 
mL/min received high-dose cytarabine, the incidence 
of neurotoxicity was found to be 8%, which correlates 
with the overall incidence of this adverse effect.

Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug which does not exhibit 
any pharmacological activity. After oral administration, 
dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to 
dabigatran by esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and 
in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle 
in plasma.
Mainly excreted in the urine (85%) and 6% via the faeces.

Metabolism
Metabolism is mainly by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 
isoenzymes to form hydroxy-dabrafenib, which is further 
oxidised via CYP3A4 to form carboxy-dabrafenib. 
Carboxy-dabrafenib can be decarboxylated via a non-
enzymatic process to form desmethyl-dabrafenib. 
Carboxy-dabrafenib is excreted in bile and urine. 
Desmethyl-dabrafenib may also be formed in the gut 
and reabsorbed. Desmethyl-dabrafenib is metabolised 
by CYP3A4 to oxidative metabolites. Both hydroxy- 
and desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to 
the clinical activity of dabrafenib while the activity of 
carboxy-darafenib is not likely to be significant.

Metabolism
Liver and the reticulo-endothelial system are the sites of 
biotransformation of dalteparin. It is partially metabolised 
by desulphatation and depolymerisation. The kidneys are 
the major site of dalteparin excretion (approximately 70% 
based on animal studies).

•
Low molecular weight heparins are renally excreted 
and hence accumulate in severe renal impairment. 
While the doses recommended for prophylaxis 
against DVT and prevention of thrombus formation 
in extracorporeal circuits are well tolerated in 
patients with ERF, the doses recommended for 
treatment of DVT and PE have been associated with 
severe, sometimes fatal, bleeding episodes in such 
patients. Hence the use of unfractionated heparin 
would be preferable in these instances.
•
In patients with GFR≤30 mL/min, monitoring for 
anti-Xa levels is recommended to determine the 
appropriate dalteparin dose. Target anti-Xa range is 
0.5–1.5 IU/mL. When monitoring anti-Xa in these 
patients, sampling should be performed 4–6 hrs after 
dosing and only after the patient has received 3–4 
doses.
•
Antifactor-Xa levels should be regularly monitored 
in new patients on haemodialysis, during the first 
weeks; later, less frequent monitoring is generally 
required. Consult manufacturer’s literature.
•
Additional doses may be required if using LMWHs 
for anticoagulation in HDF.
•
Bleeding may occur especially at high doses 
corresponding with antifactor-Xa levels greater than 
1.5 IU/mL.
•
The prolongation of the APTT induced by 
dalteparin is fully neutralised by protamine, but the 
anti-Xa activity is only neutralised to about 25–50%.
•
1 mg of protamine inhibits the effect of 100 IU 
(antifactor-Xa) of dalteparin.
•
Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of 
aldosterone leading to hypercalcaemia, particularly in 
patients with chronic renal impairment and diabetes 
mellitus.
•
Alternative dosing for haemodialysis is 70 IU/kg 
as a single bolus into the arterial line at the start of 
dialysis; the dose may need to be greatly reduced in 
people on warfarin. An anti-Xa level >0.4 IU/ml 
after 4 hours of dialysis inhibits significant clotting 
during haemodialysis. (Sagedal S, Hartmann A, 
Sundstrom K, 
et al
. A single dose of dalteparin 
effectively prevents clotting during haemodialysis.

Metabolism
Dantrolene is inactivated by hepatic metabolism in the 
first instance. There are two alternative pathways. Most 
of the drug is hydroxylated to 5-hydroxydantrolene. 
The minor pathway involves nitro-reduction to amino-
dantrolene, which is then acetylated (compound F-490). 
The 5-hydroxy metabolite is a muscle relaxant with nearly 
the same potency as the parent molecule, and may have 
a longer half-life than the parent compound. Compound 
F-490 is much less potent and is probably inactive at the 
concentrations achieved in clinical samples. Metabolites 
are subsequently excreted in the urine in the ratio of 79 
5 hydroxy-dantrolene: 17 compound F-490: 4 unaltered 
dantrolene (salt or free acid). The proportion of drug 
excreted in the faeces depends upon dose size.

Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily 
to dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an 
inactive metabolite. The formation of dapagliflozin 
3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an enzyme 
present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated 
metabolism was a minor clearance pathway in humans.
About 75% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 21%

Dapsone undergoes enterohepatic recycling. Dapsone is 
acetylated to monoacetyldapsone, the major metabolite, 
and other mono and diacetyl derivatives. Acetylation 
shows genetic polymorphism. Hydroxylation is the other 
major metabolic pathway resulting in hydroxylamine 
dapsone, which may be responsible for dapsone-
associated methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis.
Dapsone is mainly excreted in the urine, only 20% of a

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a

therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
D

Daptomycin
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

•
No formal studies have been done by the

•
Daratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels 
on RBCs and may result in a positive indirect 
Coombs test. This may persist for up to 6 months 
after the last daratumumab infusion. It should be 
recognised that daratumumab bound to RBCs may 
mask detection of antibodies to minor antigens in 
the patient's serum. The determination of a patient's 
ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted. Patients 
should be typed and screened prior to starting 
daratumumab treatment. Phenotyping may be 
considered prior to starting daratumumab treatment 
as per local practice. Red blood cell genotyping is not 
impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at 
any time.
•
Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal 
antibody that can be detected on both the serum 
protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation 
assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous

Metabolism
The metabolic fate of both endogenous and recombinant 
erythropoietin is poorly understood. Current evidence 
from studies in animals suggests that hepatic metabolism 
contributes only minimally to elimination of the intact 
hormone, but desialylated epoetin (ie, terminal sialic 
acid groups removed) appears to undergo substantial 
hepatic clearance via metabolic pathways and/or binding. 
Desialylation and/or removal of the oligosaccharide side 
chains of erythropoietin appear to occur principally in the 
liver; bone marrow also may have a role in catabolism of 
the hormone.
Elimination of desialylated drug by the kidneys, bone 
marrow, and spleen also may occur; results of animal 
studies suggest that proximal renal tubular secretion may 
be involved in renal elimination. In preclinical studies it 
has been shown that renal clearance of darbepoetin is 
minimal (up to 2% of total clearance).

Metabolism
Dasabuvir is mainly metabolised by CYP2C8 and to 
a lesser extent by CYP3A. Seven metabolites were 
identified in plasma. The most abundant plasma 
metabolite was M1, which represented 21% of drug-
related radioactivity (AUC) in circulation following single 
dose; it is formed via oxidative metabolism predominantly 
by CYP2C8.
Following a 400 mg 
14
C-dasabuvir dose, approximately 
94% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces with 
limited radioactivity (approximately 2%) in urine. 
Unchanged dasabuvir accounted for 26.2% and M1 for 
31.5% of the total dose in faeces. M1 is mainly cleared 
through direct biliary excretion with the contribution of 
UGT-mediated glucuronidation and, to a small extent, 
oxidative metabolism.

enzymes. Cytochrome P450 isoenzyme-mediated 
metabolism appears to be minor. Deconjugation of 
the glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent 
enterohepatic recycling are likely to occur.
It is excreted mainly in the faeces via bile, as metabolites 
and as unchanged drug. About 8% of a dose is excreted in

Metabolism
Deflazacort is immediately converted by plasma 
esterases to the pharmacologically active metabolite (D 
21-OH). It is 40% protein-bound and has no affinity for 
corticosteroid-binding-globulin (transcortin). Elimination 
takes place primarily through the kidneys; 70% of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine. The remaining 
30% is eliminated in the faeces. Metabolism of D 21-OH 
is extensive; only 18% of urinary excretion represents 
D 21-OH. The metabolite of D 21-OH, deflazacort 
6-beta-OH, represents one third of the urinary 
elimination.

Drug Dosage in 
Renal Insufficiency
 by Seyffart G.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
When given parenterally desferrioxamine forms chelates 
with iron and aluminium ions to form ferrioxamine and 
aluminoxamine, respectively. The chelates are excreted 
in the urine and faeces via the bile. Desferrioxamine is 
metabolised, mainly in the plasma. Four metabolites of 
desferrioxamine were isolated from urine of patients with 
iron overload. The following biotransformation reactions 
were found to occur with desferrioxamine: transamination 
and oxidation yielding an acid metabolite, beta-oxidation 
also yielding an acid metabolite, decarboxylation and 
N-hydroxylation yielding neutral metabolites.

Metabolism
Corticosteroids are metabolised mainly in the liver 
but also in other tissues, and are excreted in the urine. 
The slower metabolism of the synthetic corticosteroids 
with their lower protein-binding affinity may account 
for their increased potency compared with the natural 
corticosteroids. Up to 65% of a dose of dexamethasone is 
excreted in urine within 24 hours.

Metabolism
Didanosine is metabolised intracellularly to the active 
antiviral metabolite dideoxyadenosine triphosphate. 
The terminal metabolism of didanosine in man has not 
been evaluated. However, based on animal studies, it is 
presumed that it follows the same pathways responsible

Metabolism
Digoxin is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine by 
glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; reabsorption 
also occurs. Extensive metabolism has been reported in a 
minority of patients Metabolites that have been detected 
in the urine include digoxigenin, dihydrodigoxigenin, 
the mono- and bisdigitoxosides of digoxigenin, and 
dihydrodigoxin. Digoxigenin mono- and bisdigitoxosides 
are known to be cardioactive whereas dihydrodigoxin is 
probably much less active than digoxin.
In about 10% of patients there is considerable reduction 
to cardio-inactive metabolites, chiefly dihydrodigoxin, 
and 40% or more of a dose may be excreted in the urine 
as dihydrodigoxin. Bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal 
tract appear to be responsible for this metabolism and 
antibacterials can reduce the process.
Excretion of digoxin is proportional to the glomerular 
filtration rate. After intravenous injection 50–70% of the 
dose is excreted unchanged.

Dihydrocodeine is metabolised in the liver via 
the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6, to 
dihydromorphine, which has potent analgesic activity, 
although the analgesic effect of dihydrocodeine appears 
to be mainly due to the parent compound; some is also

Metabolism
Disulfiram is rapidly reduced to diethyldithiocarbamate, 
mainly by the glutathione reductase system in 
erythrocytes; reduction may also occur in the liver. 
Diethyldithiocarbamate is metabolised in the liver to its 
glucuronide and methyl ester and to diethylamine, carbon 
disulfide, and sulfate ions. Metabolites are excreted mainly 
in the urine; carbon disulfide is exhaled in the breath.

Metabolism
Donepezil hydrochloride is both excreted in the urine 
intact and metabolised by the cytochrome P450 
system to multiple metabolites, not all of which have 
been identified. Following administration of a single 
5 mg dose of [
14
C]-labelled donepezil hydrochloride, 
plasma radioactivity, expressed as a percentage of the 
administered dose, was present primarily as intact 
donepezil hydrochloride (30%), 6-O-desmethyl donepezil 
(11% – only metabolite that exhibits activity similar to 
donepezil hydrochloride), donepezil-cis-N-oxide (9%), 
5-O-desmethyl donepezil (7%) and the glucuronide 
conjugate of 5-O-desmethyl donepezil (3%).
Approximately 57% of the total administered 
radioactivity was recovered from the urine, and 14.5% was 
recovered from the faeces, suggesting biotransformation 
and urinary excretion as the primary routes of 
elimination. There is no evidence to suggest enterohepatic 
recirculation of donepezil hydrochloride and/or any of its 
metabolites.

Metabolism
The elimination of doxorubicin from the blood 
is triphasic with mean half-lives of 12 minutes 
(distribution), 3.3 hours and about 30 hours. Doxorubicin 
undergoes rapid metabolism in the liver. The main 
metabolite is the pharmacologically active doxorubicinol. 
Other metabolites are deoxyrubicin aglycone, glucuronide 
and sulphate conjugate.
About 40–50% of a dose is excreted in bile within 7 days, 
of which about half is excreted as unchanged drug and the 
rest as metabolites. Only 5–15% of the administered dose 
is eliminated in urine.

Comments
For bladder instillation, concentration of doxorubicin in 
bladder should be 50 mg per 50 mL. To avoid undue dilution 
in urine, the patient should be instructed not to drink any 
fluid in the 12 hours prior to instillation. This should limit 
urine production to approximately 50 mL per hour.

early after treatment initiation and reaches a plateau 
after 7 days. It is recommended to measure plasma 
creatinine values prior to and 7 days after initiation 
of dronedarone. If an increase in creatininemia is 
observed, serum creatinine should be re-measured 
after a further 7 days. If no further increase in 
creatinine is observed, this value should be used as 
the new reference baseline taking into account that 
this may be expected with dronedarone. If serum 
creatinine continues to rise then consideration 
should be given to further investigation and

Metabolism
Unchanged edoxaban is main form in plasma. 
Edoxaban is metabolised via hydrolysis (mediated 
by carboxylesterase 1), conjugation or oxidation by 
CYP3A4/5 (<10%). Edoxaban has 3 active metabolites, 
the predominant metabolite (M-4), formed by hydrolysis, 
is active and reaches less than 10% of the exposure of the 
parent compound in healthy subjects. Exposure to the 
other metabolites is less than 5%. Edoxaban is a substrate 
for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but 
not a substrate for uptake transporters such as organic 
anion transporter polypeptide OATP1B1, organic 
anion transporters OAT1 or OAT3 or organic cation 
transporter OCT2. Its active metabolite is a substrate for 
OATP1B1.
Renal clearance accounts for approximately 35% of the 
administered dose. Metabolism and biliary/intestinal 
excretion account for the remaining clearance.

Studies in humans and 
in vitro
 studies using human 
liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz 
is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 
system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent 
glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These 
metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV-1. The 
in vitro
 studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are 
the major isozymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism 
and that it inhibited P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. 
In 
in vitro 
studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and 
inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations 
well above those achieved clinically.

Metabolism
In vitro
 studies indicate that eletriptan is primarily 
metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzyme 
CYP3A4. This finding is substantiated by increased 
plasma concentrations of eletriptan following 
co-administration with erythromycin and ketoconazole
, 
known selective and potent CYP3A4 inhibitor
s
. 
In vitro
studies also indicate a small involvement of CYP2D6 
although clinical studies do not indicate any evidence of 
polymorphism with this enzyme.
There are two major circulating metabolites identified 
that significantly contribute to plasma radioactivity 
following administration of 
14
C-labelled eletriptan. The 
metabolite formed by N-oxidation, has demonstrated no 
activity in animal 
in vitro
 models. The metabolite formed 
by N-demethylation, has been demonstrated to have 
similar activity to eletriptan in animal 
in vitro
 models. 
A third area of radioactivity in plasma has not been 
formally identified, but is most likely to be a mixture of 
hydroxylated metabolites which have also been observed 
excreted in urine and faeces.
The plasma concentrations of the N-demethylated 
active metabolite are only 10–20% of those of parent, 
so would not be expected to significantly contribute to 
the therapeutic action of eletriptan. Non-renal clearance 
accounts for approximately 90% of the total clearance 
indicating that eletriptan is eliminated primarily by 
metabolism.

Other information
•
Patients with impaired renal function should use 
eltrombopag with caution and close monitoring, for 
example by measuring creatinine and/or urine analysis.
•
LFTs should be measured before treatment and 
then every 2 weeks while the dose is adjusted; once 
the dose is established, monthly monitoring is 
recommended. Tests should be repeated within 3–5 
days if found to be abnormal, liver function should 
be monitored every week. If alanine aminotransferase 
levels increase to 3 times the upper limit of normal or 
above, and these are progressive or persist for 4 weeks 
or longer or are accompanied by increased bilirubin 
or by signs of hepatic injury or decompensation, 
eltrombopag should be stopped.
•
The most common serious adverse effect of 
eltrombopag is haemorrhage.
•
Following administration of a single 50 mg dose, 
the AUC
0-∞
  of eltrombopag was 32–36% lower in 
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, 
and 60% lower in severe renal impairment compared 
with healthy volunteers.
•
Plasma-eltrombopag exposure is about 70% higher 
in some patients of East Asian origin (e.g. Japanese, 
Chinese, Taiwanese, and Korean), compared with 
Caucasian patients so a lower starting dose is 
recommended.

The study showed no increase in side effects despite 
an increase in exposure in the ESRD patients. The 
second study looked at patients with CKD 4 with 
type 2 diabetes (n=8). In contrast to the other study 
they did not find such a big increase in half-life in

Metabolism
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The 
biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of 
the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers 
(approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic 
acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys 
with complete recovery of the dose achieved in urine 
(approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). 
13% of the emtricitabine dose was recovered in urine as 
three metabolites.

In patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, 
approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose 
was recovered in dialysate over a 3 hour dialysis 
period which had been started within 1.5 hours of 
emtricitabine dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL/min

•
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined 
following administration of a single dose of 200 mg 
emtricitabine hard capsules to 30 non-HIV infected 
subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency. 
Subjects were grouped according to baseline

function; 50–80 mL/min as mild impairment; 30–
49 mL/min as moderate impairment; <30 mL/min 
as severe impairment; <15 mL/min as functionally

•
From December 2016, the manufacturer has changed 
the dosing in severe renal impairment in line with 
European guidelines. It is now contraindicated for all 
indications in severe renal impairment apart from its 
use for dialysis anti-coagulation.
•
A linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma 
clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has 
been observed, which indicates decreased clearance 
of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal 
function. In patients with severe renal impairment 
(CRCL< 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is 
significantly increased by an average of 65% after 
repeated, once daily subcutaneous doses of 40 mg.
•
In extracorporeal circulation during haemodialysis, 
1 mg/kg enoxaparin is introduced into the arterial 
line of the circuit at the beginning of the session. The 
effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour

session. If fibrin rings are found, a further dose of 
0.5–1 mg/kg may be given.
•
For patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the 
dose should be reduced to 0.5 mg/kg for double 
vascular access or 0.75 mg/kg for single vascular 
access.
•
The dose of protamine to neutralise the effect of 
enoxaparin should equal the dose of enoxaparin: 50 
anti-heparin units of protamine should neutralise 
the anti-factor-Xa activity generated by 1 mg of 
enoxaparin. If prothrombin time is still raised 2–4 
hours later give 0.5 mg/kg infusion of protamine.

•
Manufacturer advises monitoring of the anti-
factor-Xa activity, whatever the severity of the 
renal impairment, when treatment doses are being 
employed. They also advise monitoring patients if 
given prolonged treatment with prophylactic doses.
•
Low molecular weight heparins are renally excreted 
and hence accumulate in severe renal impairment. 
While the doses recommended for prophylaxis 
against DVT and prevention of thrombus formation 
in extracorporeal circuits are well tolerated in 
patients with ESRF, the doses recommended for 
treatment of DVT and PE have been associated with 
severe, sometimes fatal, bleeding episodes in such 
patients. Hence the use of unfractionated heparin 
would be preferable in these instances.

Additional doses may be required if using LMWHs

Epirubicin is extensively and rapidly metabolised in 
the liver; 27–40% eliminated by biliary excretion. Slow 
elimination through the liver is due to extensive tissue 
distribution. Also is metabolised in other organs and cells, 
including red blood cells. Four main metabolic pathways 
have been identified. Only the metabolite epirubicinol 
(13-OH epirubicin) appears to have cytotoxic activity; 
however, epirubicinol is unlikely to reach 
in vivo 
concentrations sufficient to produce cytotoxic effects. 
Epirubicin and its major metabolites are eliminated in 
faeces via biliary excretion (40% of the administered dose 
being recovered in the bile in 72 hours) and to a lesser

Metabolism
Eplerenone metabolism is primarily mediated via 
CYP3A4. No active metabolites of eplerenone have 
been identified in human plasma. Less than 5% of 
an eplerenone dose is recovered as unchanged drug 
in the urine and faeces. Following a single oral dose 
of radiolabelled drug, approximately 32% of the dose 
was excreted in the faeces and approximately 67% was 
excreted in the urine.

Metabolism
The metabolic fate of both endogenous and recombinant 
erythropoietin is poorly understood. Current evidence 
from studies in animals suggests that hepatic metabolism 
contributes only minimally to elimination of the 
intact
hormone, but desialylated epoetin (i.e. terminal sialic 
acid groups removed) appears to undergo substantial 
hepatic clearance via metabolic pathways and/or binding. 
Desialylation and/or removal of the oligosaccharide side 
chains of erythropoietin appear to occur principally in 
the liver; bone marrow also may have a role in catabolism 
of the hormone. Elimination of desialylated drug by the 
kidneys, bone marrow, and spleen also may occur; results 
of animal studies suggest that proximal renal tubular 
secretion may be involved in renal elimination.

Metabolism
Erlotinib is metabolised mainly by the cytochrome P450 
isoenzyme CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2. 
Extrahepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 in intestine, 
CYP1A1 in lung, and 1B1 in tumour tissue potentially 
contribute to the metabolic clearance of erlotinib. 
Metabolic pathways include demethylation, to metabolites 
OSI-420 and OSI-413, oxidation, and aromatic 
hydroxylation. The metabolites OSI-420 and OSI-413 
have comparable potency to erlotinib in non-clinical 
in 
vitro
 assays and 
in vivo
 tumour models. They are present 
in plasma at levels that are <10 % of erlotinib and display 
similar pharmacokinetics as erlotinib. Erlotinib is excreted 
predominantly as metabolites via the faeces (>90%) with 
renal elimination accounting for only a small amount 
(approximately 9%) of an oral dose. Less than 2% of the 
orally administered dose is excreted as parent substance.

recommended in US data sheet.
•
Doses in renal impairment are from 
Drug Prescribing 
in Renal Failure
, 5
th
 edition by Aronoff 
et al.
•
Approximately 30% of dose is dialysed after a 4-hour 
haemodialysis session.
•
Anecdotally ertapenem has been used at a dose of 1 g 
3 times a week in haemodialysis patients.
•
Give at least 6 hours before haemodialysis session if 
unable to give post dialysis.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

-demethylation to inactive, unidentified metabolites. 
It is excreted in high concentrations in the bile and 
undergoes intestinal reabsorption. About 2–5% of an

Metabolism
Escitalopram is metabolised in the liver to the 
demethylated and didemethylated metabolites. Both 
of these are pharmacologically active. Alternatively, 
the nitrogen may be oxidised to form the N-oxide 
metabolite. Both parent substance and metabolites are 
partly excreted as glucuronides. After multiple dosing 
the mean concentrations of the demethyl and didemethyl 
metabolites are usually 28–31% and <5%, respectively, 
of the escitalopram concentration. Biotransformation of 
escitalopram to the demethylated metabolite is mediated 
primarily by CYP2C19. Some contribution by the 
enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is possible. The major 
metabolites have a significantly longer half-life than the 
parent drug.
Escitalopram and major metabolites are assumed to be 
eliminated by both hepatic and renal routes, with the 
major part of the dose excreted as metabolites in the 
urine.

Metabolism
Esomeprazole is completely metabolised by the cytochrome 
P450 system (CYP). The major part of the metabolism of 
esomeprazole is dependent on the polymorphic CYP2C19, 
responsible for the formation of the hydroxy- and 
desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole. The remaining 
part is dependent on another specific isoform, CYP3A4, 
responsible for the formation of esomeprazole sulphone, 
the main metabolite in plasma. The major metabolites of 
esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion.
Almost 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted 
as metabolites in the urine, the remainder in the faeces. 
Less than 1% of the parent drug is found in urine.

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Etoricoxib is extensively metabolised with <1% of a dose 
recovered in urine as the parent drug. The major route 
of metabolism to form the 6'-hydroxymethyl derivative 
is catalysed by CYP enzymes. CYP3A4 appears to 
contribute to the metabolism of etoricoxib 
in vivo. 
Five 
metabolites have been identified in man. The principal 
metabolite is the 6'-carboxylic acid derivative of etoricoxib 
formed by further oxidation of the 6'-hydroxymethyl 
derivative. These principal metabolites either demonstrate 
no measurable activity or are only weakly active as COX-2 
inhibitors. None of these metabolites inhibit COX-1.
Elimination of etoricoxib occurs almost exclusively 
through metabolism followed by renal excretion.
Following administration of a single 25-mg radiolabeled 
intravenous dose of etoricoxib to healthy subjects, 70% 
of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 20% in faeces, 
mostly as metabolites. Less than 2% was recovered as

Metabolism
Everolimus is metabolised in the liver and to some 
extent in the gastrointestinal wall, and is a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
CYP3A4. Six main metabolites of everolimus have 
been detected in human blood, including three 
monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-
opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate 
of everolimus. These metabolites were shown to have 
approximately 100 times less activity than everolimus 
itself. Following the administration of a single dose of 
radiolabelled everolimus, 80% of the radioactivity was 
recovered from the faeces, while 5% was excreted in the 
urine. The parent substance was not detected in urine or 
faeces.

Metabolism
Ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively conjugated 
to a pharmacologically-active phenolic glucuronide 
(ezetimibe-glucuronide). Ezetimibe is metabolised 
primarily in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide 
conjugation (a phase II reaction) with subsequent biliary 
excretion. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are 
the major drug-derived compounds detected in plasma, 
constituting approximately 10–20% and 80–90% of the 
total drug in plasma, respectively. Both ezetimibe and 
ezetimibe-glucuronide are slowly eliminated from plasma 
with evidence of significant enterohepatic recycling. 
Following oral administration of 
14
 C 
-
ezetimibe (20 
mg) to human subjects, total ezetimibe accounted for 
approximately 93% of the total radioactivity in plasma.

respectively, over a 10
-

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
After oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly 
hydrolysed by esterases to the active metabolite fenofibric 
acid.
No unchanged fenofibrate can be detected in the plasma. 
Fenofibric acid is excreted mainly in the urine, mainly as 
the glucuronide conjugate, but also as a reduced form of 
fenofibric acid and its glucuronide; practically all the drug 
is eliminated from the body within 6 days.

Metabolism
Fentanyl is metabolised in the liver by

-dealkylation 
and hydroxylation via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 
CYP3A4. Metabolites and some unchanged drug are 
excreted mainly in the urine. The short duration of action 
is probably due to rapid redistribution into the tissues 
rather than metabolism and excretion. The relatively 
longer elimination half-life reflects slower release 
from tissue depots.The main metabolites of fentanyl, 
which are excreted in the urine, have been identified 
as 4-

Filgrastim is primarily eliminated by the kidney and 
neutrophils/neutrophil precursors; the latter presumably 
involves binding of the growth factor to the G-CSF 
receptor on the cell surface, internalisation of the growth 
factor-receptor complexes via endocytosis, and subsequent 
degradation inside the cells.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Fludrocortisone is hydrolysed to produce the non-
esterified alcohol. In human volunteers, excretion through 
urine was about 80%, and it was concluded that about 
20% were excreted by a different route. It is likely that, as 
for the metabolism of other steroids, excretion into the 
bile is balanced by re-absorption in the intestine and some 
part is excreted with the faeces.

Metabolism
Flumazenil is extensively metabolised in the liver. 
The carboxylic acid metabolite is the main metabolite 
in plasma (free form) and urine (free form and its 
glucuronide). This main metabolite showed no 
benzodiazepine agonist or antagonist activity in 
pharmacological tests.
Flumazenil is almost completely (99%) eliminated by 
non-renal routes. Practically no unchanged flumazenil 
is excreted in the urine, suggesting complete metabolic 
degradation of the drug. Elimination of radiolabelled drug 
is essentially complete within 72 hours, with 90–95% of 
the radioactivity appearing in urine and 5–10% in the 
faeces.

Metabolism
After intravenous injection fluorouracil is cleared rapidly 
from plasma. It is distributed throughout body tissues 
and fluids, and disappears from the plasma within about 
3 hours. Within the target cell fluorouracil is converted 
to 5-fluorouridine monophosphate and floxuridine 
monophosphate (5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate), 
the former undergoing conversion to the triphosphate 
which can be incorporated into RNA while the latter 
inhibits thymidylate synthetase. About 15% of an 
intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine 
within 6 hours. Approximately 80% is inactivated mainly 
in the liver and is catabolised via dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase (DPD) similarly to endogenous uracil, 
60–80% is excreted as respiratory carbon dioxide; urea 
and other metabolites are also produced, and 2–3% by the 
biliary system.

the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, with only 
a small amount metabolised by CYP3A4. The major 
components circulating in the blood are fluvastatin and 
the pharmacologically inactive N-desisopropyl-propionic 
acid metabolite. The hydroxylated metabolites have 
pharmacological activity but do not circulate systemically.
About 93% is excreted in the faeces, mainly as metabolites,

Folic acid given therapeutically enters the portal 
circulation largely unchanged, since it is a poor substrate 
for reduction by dihydrofolate reductase. It is converted 
to the metabolically active form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate 
in the plasma and liver. Folate undergoes enterohepatic 
circulation. Folate metabolites are eliminated in the urine 
and folate in excess of body requirements is excreted 
unchanged in the urine.

is absorbed through the gut epithelium, following oral 
administration. The primary route of metabolism of 
amprenavir is via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.
The primary route of elimination of amprenavir is 
via hepatic metabolism with less than 1% excreted 
unchanged in the urine and no detectable amprenavir 
in faeces. Metabolites account for approximately 14%

going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis

Fosfomycin undergoes no biotransformation and is 
excreted mainly unchanged through the kidneys. This 
results in very high urinary concentrations (up to 3 
mg/mL) within 2–4 hours of a dose. Therapeutic 
concentrations of 200–300 mcg/mL in urine are usually 
maintained for at least 36 hours, and can last from 48–72 
hours.

Metabolism
Fosphenytoin is rapidly and completely hydrolysed 
to phenytoin with a conversion half-life of about 15 
minutes; one mmol of fosphenytoin yields one mmol 
of phenytoin. Phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver to 
inactive metabolites chiefly 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-
phenylhydantoin by an enzyme system which is saturable.
Phenytoin undergoes enterohepatic recycling and 
is excreted in the urine, mainly as its hydroxylated 
metabolite, in either free or conjugated form.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

GTN undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the 
liver. It is taken up by smooth muscle cells of blood vessels 
and the nitrate group is cleaved to inorganic nitrite and 
then to nitric oxide. This reaction requires the presence 
of cysteine or another thiol. Glyceryl trinitrate also 
undergoes hydrolysis in plasma and is rapidly metabolised 
in the liver by glutathione-organic nitrate reductase to 
dinitrates and mononitrates.

Metabolism
Granisetron is metabolised primarily in the liver by 
oxidation followed by conjugation. The major compounds 
are 7-OH-granisetron and its sulphate and glycuronide 
conjugates. Although antiemetic properties have 
been observed for 7-OH-granisetron and indazoline 
N-desmethyl granisetron, it is unlikely that these 
contribute significantly to the pharmacological activity 
of granisetron in man. Clearance is predominantly by 
hepatic metabolism. Urinary excretion of unchanged 
granisetron averages 12% of dose whilst that of 
metabolites amounts to about 47% of dose. The 
remainder is excreted in faeces as metabolites.

Metabolism
Haloperidol is metabolised in the liver and is excreted in 
the urine and, via the bile in the faeces; there is evidence 
of enterohepatic recycling. Routes of metabolism of 
haloperidol include oxidative 
N
-dealkylation, particularly 
via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6, glucuronidation, and reduction of the ketone 
group to form an alcohol known as reduced haloperidol. 
Metabolites are ultimately conjugated with glycine 
and excreted in the urine. There is debate over the 
pharmacological activity of the metabolites.

Metabolism
Hydralazine undergoes considerable first-pass 
metabolism by acetylation in the gastrointestinal 
mucosa and liver. The rate of metabolism is genetically 
determined and depends upon the acetylator status of 
the individual. Systemic metabolism in the liver is by 
hydroxylation of the ring system and conjugation with 
glucuronic acid; most sources suggest that 
N
-acetylation 
is not of major importance in systemic clearance and that 
therefore acetylator status does not affect elimination.
Hydralazine is excreted mainly in urine as metabolites.

Metabolism
Hydroxyzine is extensively metabolised. The formation 
of the major metabolite cetirizine, a carboxylic acid 
metabolite (approximately 45% of the oral dose), is 
mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. This metabolite has 
significant peripheral H1-antagonist properties. The 
other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated 
metabolite, and an O-dealkylated metabolite with a 
plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated 
principally by CYP3A4/5. Only 0.8% of the dose is 
excreted unchanged in urine. The major metabolite 
cetirizine is excreted mainly unchanged in urine (25% and 
16 % of the hydroxyzine oral and IM dose, respectively).

Metabolism
The main metabolic pathway is the hydrolytic cleavage 
of the ester bond. Orally administered hyoscine 
butylbromide is excreted in the faeces and in the 
urine. Studies in man show that 2–5% of radioactive 
doses is eliminated renally after oral, and 0.7–1.6% 
after rectal administration. Approximately 90% of 
recovered radioactivity can be found in the faeces after 
oral administration. The urinary excretion of hyoscine 
butylbromide is less than 0.1% of the dose. The 
metabolites excreted via the renal route bind poorly to 
muscarinic receptors and are therefore not considered to 
contribute to the effect of the hyoscine butylbromide.

Metabolism
After initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly 
binds to bone or is excreted into urine. There is no 
evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals 
or humans. The absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid 
is removed from the circulation via bone absorption 
(estimated to be 40–50% in postmenopausal women) 
and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. 
The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated 
unchanged in the faeces. Renal clearance accounts for 
50–60% of total clearance and is related to creatinine 
clearance. The difference between the apparent total and 
renal clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by 
bone.

Metabolism
Idarubicin is extensively metabolised, both in the liver and 
extrahepatically; the principal metabolite, idarubicinol 
(13-dihydroidarubicin) has equal antineoplastic activity. 
Peak concentrations of idarubicin and idarubicinol 
in bone marrow and nucleated blood cells are 400 
(idarubicin) and 200 (idarubicinol) times greater than 
those in plasma; cellular concentrations of drug and 
metabolite decline with apparent terminal half-lives of 
15 and 72 hours respectively, whereas plasma half-lives 
are reported to be 20–22 hours and about 45 hours 
respectively. Idarubicin is excreted in bile, and to a lesser 
extent in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. 17% 
(IV) / 8% (oral) is recovered in the faeces over 5 days and

Metabolism
The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide are reported to 
exhibit considerable inter-individual variation. It is 
a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in 
the liver, to both active and inactive alkylating metabolites; 
there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated 
at very high doses. After repeated doses (fractionated 
therapy) there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, 
apparently due to auto-induction of metabolism. It is 
excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug (80%) and 
metabolites.

Administration
Reconstitution
Dilute 0.1 mg with 500 mL sodium chloride 0.9% or 
glucose 5%. Final concentration = 0.2 micrograms 
iloprost/mL.
Route
Nebulised, IV infusion via peripheral vein or central 
venous catheter.
Rate of administration
Infuse 0.1mg over 6 hours daily (see below).
Comments
•
Treatment should be started at an infusion rate of 10 
mL/hour for 30 minutes, which corresponds to a dose 
of 0.5 nanograms/kg/minute for a patient of 65 kg.
•
Then increase dose in steps of 10 mL/hour every 30 
minutes up to a rate of 40 mL/hour (50 mL/hour if 
patient’s body weight is more than 75 kg).
•
If side effects occur (e.g. headache, nausea, or an 
undesired drop in BP), infusion rate should be 
reduced until the tolerable dose is found; if side 
effects are severe, infusion should be interrupted.
•
For rest of the treatment period, continue with dose 
found to be tolerated in the first 2–3 days.
Other information
•
BP and heart rate must be measured at the start of 
the infusion and after every increase in dose.
•
Duration of treatment is up to 4 weeks. Shorter 
treatment periods (3–5 days) are often sufficient in 
Raynaud’s phenomenon.
•
Iloprost infusions can also be used to control blood 
pressure during a scleroderma hypertensive crisis.
•
For fluid-restricted patients, dilute 0.1 mg iloprost 
with 50 mL sodium chloride 0.9%, and run at a rate 
of 1–4 mL/hour.
•
Toxic by inhalation, contact with skin, and if 
swallowed.

Metabolism
The main circulating metabolite in humans is the 
N-demethylated piperazine derivative, which shows 
similar 
in vitro
 potency to the parent. Imatinib and the 
N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 
65% of the circulating radioactivity (AUC
(0–48h)
). The 
remaining circulating radioactivity consisted of a number 
of minor metabolites. 
In vitro
 results showed that 
CYP3A4 was the major human P450 enzyme catalysing 
the biotransformation of imatinib. Based on the recovery 
of compound(s) after an oral [
14
C]-labelled dose of 
imatinib, approximately 81% of the dose was recovered 
within 7 days in faeces (68% of dose) and urine (13% of 
dose). Unchanged imatinib accounted for 25% of the dose 
(5% urine, 20% faeces), the remainder being metabolites.

Metabolism
Imipramine is extensively demethylated by first-pass 
metabolism in the liver, to its primary active metabolite, 
desipramine (desmethylimipramine). Paths of 
metabolism of both imipramine and desipramine include 
hydroxylation and 
N
-oxidation.
About 80% is excreted in the urine and about 20% in the 
faeces, mainly in the form of inactive metabolites. Urinary 
excretion of unchanged imipramine and of the active 
metabolite desipramine is about 5% and 6% respectively. 
Only small quantities of these are excreted in the faeces.

was not detected in the urine of healthy male subjects 
following administration via IV, IM or SC routes. 
In vitro
hepatic and renal perfusion studies demonstrate that 
the liver and kidneys are capable of clearing interferon 
gamma-1b from perfusate.
Interferon is metabolised primarily in the kidney. It is 
excreted in the urine, but is reabsorbed by the tubules 
where it undergoes lysosomal degradation.

Pre-treatment with paracetamol is recommended to 
reduce incidence of flu-like symptoms.
•
Interferon up-regulates the cell surface presentation 
of class II histocompatibility antigens, which raises 
the possibility of drug-induced allograft rejection. 
There are numerous clinical reports of allograft 
rejection, acute renal failure and graft loss after 
interferon therapy. Hence extreme care should 
be exercised in the use of interferon after renal 
transplantation.
•
In patients undergoing haemodialysis, the interferon 
molecule may accumulate as it is too large to be 
dialysed and will not undergo renal degradation. 
Hence, the dose may need to be adjusted.
•
Manufacturer advises to use with caution due to risk 
of accumulation.

C 
irbesartan, 80–85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity 
is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is 
metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and 
oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan 
glucuronide (approximately 6%). 
In vitro
 studies indicate 
that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P450 
enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.
Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both 
biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV 
administration of [
14
C]-irbesartan, about 20% of the 
radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the remainder 
in the faeces.

After intravenous doses it is hydrolysed by 
carboxylesterase in body tissues to active SN-38 (7-ethyl-
10-hydroxycamptothecin). Plasma protein binding for 
SN-38 is about 95%. SN-38 is mainly eliminated by 
glucuronidation, predominantly by the enzyme uridine 
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). 
Irinotecan is also partly metabolised by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes CYP3A4 and perhaps CYP3A5.
The majority of an intravenous dose of irinotecan is 
excreted as unchanged drug, with about 64% in the 
faeces via the bile. The mean 24 hour urinary excretion of 
irinotecan and SN-38 (its active metabolite) was 19.9%

After intravenous infusion, iron dextran is taken up by 
the cells of the reticuloendothelial cells, particularly in the 
liver and spleen. The reticuloendothelial cells gradually 
separate iron from the iron-dextran complex. Most 
absorbed iron is bound to transferrin and transported 
to the bone marrow where it is incorporated into 
haemoglobin; the remainder is contained within the 
storage forms, ferritin or haemosiderin, or as myoglobin, 
with smaller amounts occurring in haem-containing 
enzymes or in plasma bound to transferrin.
Only very small amounts of iron are excreted as the 
majority released after the destruction of the haemoglobin 
molecule is re-used.

(depends on

Metabolism
The primary metabolic route is the acetylation of 
isoniazid to acetyl-isoniazid by 
N
-acetyltransferase found 
in the liver and small intestine. Acetyl-isoniazid is then 
hydrolysed to isonicotinic acid and monoacetylhydrazine; 
isonicotinic acid is conjugated with glycine to isonicotinyl 
glycine (isonicotinuric acid) and monoacetylhydrazine 
is further acetylated to diacetylhydrazine. Some 
unmetabolised isoniazid is conjugated to hydrazones. The 
metabolites of isoniazid have no tuberculostatic activity 
and, apart from possibly monoacetylhydrazine, they are 
also less toxic. The rate of acetylation of isoniazid and 
monoacetylhydrazine is genetically determined and there 
is a bimodal distribution of persons who acetylate them 
either slowly or rapidly. In patients with normal renal 
function, over 75% of a dose appears in the urine in 24 
hours, mainly as metabolites. Small amounts of drug are 
also excreted in the faeces.

Metabolism
Isosorbide dinitrate undergoes extensive first-pass 
metabolism in the liver. It is taken up by smooth muscle 
cells of blood vessels and the nitrate group is cleaved 
to inorganic nitrite and then to nitric oxide. It is also 
rapidly metabolised in the liver to the major active 
metabolites isosorbide 2-mononitrate and isosorbide 
5-mononitrate. Isosorbide mononitrate is metabolised to 
inactive metabolites, including isosorbide and isosorbide 
glucuronide. Only about 2% of isosorbide mononitrate is 
excreted unchanged in the urine.

Isotretinoin undergoes metabolism in the gut wall and 
first-pass metabolism in the liver. It is metabolised in the 
liver by CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 to 
its major metabolite 4-oxo-isotretinoin; there is also some 
isomerisation of isotretinoin to tretinoin. Isotretinoin, 
tretinoin, and their metabolites undergo enterohepatic 
recycling. Return to physiological levels of retinoids takes 
about 2 weeks after stopping therapy. Equal amounts of a

metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, has antifungal activity 
comparable with that of itraconazole.
Itraconazole is excreted mainly as inactive metabolites 
in urine (35%) and faeces (54%) within one week of an 
oral solution dose. Renal excretion of itraconazole and 
the active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole account for 
less than 1% of an intravenous dose. Based on an oral 
radiolabelled dose, faecal excretion of unchanged drug 
varies between 3–18% of the dose. Small amounts are 
eliminated in the stratum corneum and hair.

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: The 
patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ within 
the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid going through 
the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, dialysate fluid 
and replacement fluid and dividing it by 60, which gives 
a value in mL /minute, equated to a patient GFR. E.g. 
blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, filtration fluid flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, 
replacement rate (post filter) = 200 mL/hr – this gives 
a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/hr. This is then divided by 
60 to give an approximate GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose 
would then be according to the GFR rather than using 
the dialysis recommendations.

form, ixazomib. Metabolism is by multiple CYP enzymes 
and non-CYP proteins. At clinically relevant ixazomib 
concentrations, 
in vitro
 studies using human cDNA-
expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes indicate that no

from the CNS to peripheral tissues and hepatic 
biotransformation to an active metabolite norketamine. 
Other metabolic pathways include hydroxylation of the 
cyclohexone ring and conjugation with glucuronic acid. 
Ketamine is excreted mainly in the urine as metabolites.

Metabolism
Following absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract, ketoconazole is converted into several inactive 
metabolites. The major identified metabolic pathways 
are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and 
piperazine rings, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic 
hydroxylation. Plasma elimination is biphasic with a 
half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours 
thereafter. About 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, 
of which 2–4% is unchanged drug. The major route of 
excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract.

Metabolism
Two processes are involved in the biotransformation of 
ketoprofen: one very minor (hydroxylation), and the other 
largely predominant (conjugation with glucuronic acid).
Less than 1% of the dose of ketoprofen administered is 
recovered in unchanged form in the urine, whereas the 
glucuronide metabolite accounts for about 65–75%. The 
drug is excreted as metabolites essentially by the urinary 
route. The rate of excretion is rapid, since 50% of the dose 
administered is eliminated in the first 6 hours.

Metabolism
Lacidipine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism 
in the liver. The drug is eliminated primarily by hepatic 
metabolism (involving cytochrome P450 CYP3A4). 
The principal metabolites possess little, if any, 
pharmacodynamic activity.
Approximately 70% of the administered dose is 
eliminated as metabolites in the faeces and the remainder 
as metabolites in the urine.

Lamotrigine is extensively metabolised in the liver by

in urine, principally as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. 
It slightly induces its own metabolism. Only about 2% of 
lamotrigine-related material is excreted in faeces.

Other information
•
Pharmacokinetic studies using single doses in 
subjects with renal failure indicate that lamotrigine 
pharmacokinetics are little affected, but plasma 
concentrations of the major glucuronide metabolite 
increase almost 8-fold due to reduced renal clearance.
•
The 2-N-glucuronide is inactive and accounts 
for 75–90% of the metabolised drug present in 
the urine. Although the metabolite is inactive 
the consequences of accumulation are unknown; 
hence the company advise caution with the use of 
lamotrigine in renal impairment.
•
Doses in renal impairment are from 
Drug Prescribing

•
The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other 
drugs; reduced to 14 hours when given with enzyme-
inducing drugs, e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin, 
and is increased to approximately 70 hours when 
co-administered with sodium valproate alone.

Metabolism
Lenalidomide is poorly metabolised as 82% of the dose 
is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-lenalidomide 
and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% 
of the excreted dose, respectively. The renal clearance 
of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate 
and therefore is at least actively secreted to some extent. 
Approximately 4% of lenalidomide is eliminated in faeces.

Lenograstim is primarily eliminated by the kidney and 
neutrophils/neutrophil precursors; the latter presumably 
involves binding of the growth factor to the G-CSF 
receptor on the cell surface, internalisation of the growth 
factor-receptor complexes via endocytosis, and subsequent 
degradation inside the cells. During chemotherapy-
induced neutropenia, the clearance of lenograstim is 
significantly reduced and the concentration of lenograstim 
is sustained until onset of neutrophil recovery.

Metabolism
Metabolic clearance via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes

metabolite is the major elimination pathway of letrozole. 
Formation of minor unidentified metabolites and direct 
renal and faecal excretion play only a minor role in the 
overall elimination of letrozole. Within 2 weeks after 
administration of 2.5 mg [
14
C]-labelled letrozole to 
healthy postmenopausal volunteers, 88.2 ± 7.6% of the 
radioactivity was recovered in urine and 3.8 ± 0.9% in 
faeces. At least 75% of the radioactivity recovered in urine 
up to 216 hours (84.7 ± 7.8% of the dose) was attributed 
to the glucuronide of the carbinol metabolite, about 9% 
to two unidentified metabolites, and 6% to unchanged

Metabolism
Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. 
The major metabolic pathway (24% of the dose) is an 
enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, to form the 
primary metabolite, ucb L057, which is pharmacologically 
inactive.
Two minor metabolites have also been identified. One 
was obtained by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidone ring 
(1.6 % of the dose) and the other one by opening of the 
pyrrolidone ring (0.9% of the dose).
The major route of excretion was via urine, accounting 
for a mean 95% of the dose (approximately 93% of the 
dose was excreted within 48 hours). The cumulative 
urinary excretion of levetiracetam and its primary 
metabolite accounted for 66% and 24% of the dose, 
respectively during the first 48 hours.  Excretion via faeces 
accounted for only 0.3% of the dose. Levetiracetam is 
excreted by glomerular filtration with subsequent tubular 
reabsorption and the primary metabolite is also excreted 
by active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular 
filtration.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
L
Levofloxacin
585
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Levothyroxine is mainly metabolised in the liver and 
kidney to tri-iodothyronine (liothyronine) and, about 
40%, to inactive reverse tri-iodothyronine (reverse 
T
3
) both of which undergo further deiodination to 
inactive metabolites. Further metabolites result from 
conjugation and decarboxylation; tetra-iodothyroacetic 
acid (tetrac) is one such metabolite. Further hydrolysis 
of the conjugates releases free hormone, which can be 
reabsorbed in the intestine to undergo enterohepatic 
recycling. Some conjugates reach the colon unchanged, 
then undergo hydrolysis, and are eliminated in the faeces 
as free hormone. Levothyroxine is mainly eliminated 
by the kidneys as free drug, deiodinated metabolites, or 
conjugates.

Metabolism
Lidocaine is largely metabolised in the liver. First-pass 
metabolism is extensive and bioavailability is about 
35% after oral doses. Metabolism in the liver is rapid 
and about 90% of a given dose is dealkylated to form 
monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. Both of 
these metabolites may contribute to the therapeutic and 
toxic effects of lidocaine and since their half-lives are 
longer than that of lidocaine, accumulation, particularly 
of glycinexylidide, may occur during prolonged infusions. 
Further metabolism occurs and metabolites are excreted 
in the urine with less than 10% of unchanged lidocaine.

Metabolism
Linezolid is primarily metabolised by oxidation of the 
morpholine ring resulting mainly in the formation of 
two inactive open-ring carboxylic acid derivatives; the 
aminoethoxyacetic acid metabolite (PNU-142300) 
and the hydroxyethyl glycine metabolite (PNU-
142586). The hydroxyethyl glycine metabolite (PNU-
142586) is the predominant human metabolite and is 
believed to be formed by a non-enzymatic process. The 
aminoethoxyacetic acid metabolite (PNU-142300) is less 
abundant. Other minor, inactive metabolites have been 
characterised.
In patients with normal renal function or mild to 
moderate renal insufficiency, linezolid is primarily 
excreted under steady-state conditions in the urine as 
PNU-142586 (40%), parent drug (30%) and PNU-
142300 (10%). Virtually no parent drug is found in the 
faeces whilst approximately 6% and 3% of each dose 
appears as PNU-142586 and PNU-142300, respectively. 
Non-renal clearance accounts for approximately 65% of 
the total clearance of linezolid.

30% of dose is removed by a 3 hour haemodialysis

•
After single doses of 600 mg, there was a 7–8-fold 
increase in exposure to the two primary metabolites 
of linezolid in the plasma of patients with severe 
renal insufficiency (i.e. CRCL<30 mL/min). 
However, there was no increase in AUC of parent 
drug. Although there is some removal of the major 
metabolites of linezolid by haemodialysis, metabolite 
plasma levels after single 600 mg doses were still 
considerably higher following dialysis than those 
observed in patients with normal renal function or 
mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
•
In 24 patients with severe renal insufficiency, 21 of 
whom were on regular haemodialysis, peak plasma 
concentrations of the two major metabolites after 
several days dosing were about 10-fold those seen 
in patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma 
levels of linezolid were not affected.
•
In patients with GFR<10 mL/min, if platelet count 
drops on a dose of 600 mg twice daily, consider 
reducing dose to 600 mg once daily.
•
Two metabolites accumulate in renal failure which 
have MAOI activity but no antibacterial activity – 
monitor patients closely.
•
There is 5 mmol sodium per 300 mL infusion.
•
Linezolid is a weak, reversible non-selective inhibitor 
of MAO therefore can be used with drugs not 
normally given with MAOIs (e.g. SSRIs) but 
monitor closely.
•
In patients who have been on linezolid for longer 
than 28 days, there have been reports of peripheral 
neuropathy and/or optic neuropathy occasionally 
leading to loss of vision, anaemia requiring 
transfusions, and lactic acidosis – visual function 
should be monitored in these patients.

Other information
•
Close monitoring of renal function during therapy is 
necessary in those with renal insufficiency.
•
Renal failure has been reported in association with 
ACE inhibitors and has been mainly in patients with 
severe congestive heart failure, renal artery stenosis, 
and post renal transplant.
•
High incidence of anaphylactoid reactions has 
been reported in patients dialysed with high-
flux polyacrylonitrile membranes and treated 
concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor – this 
combination should therefore be avoided.
•
Hyperkalaemia and other side effects are more 
common in patients with impaired renal function.

•
Long-term treatment may result in permanent 
changes in kidney histology and impairment of renal 
function. High serum concentration of lithium, 
including episodes of acute lithium toxicity, may 
aggravate these changes. The minimum clinically 
effective dose of lithium should always be used.
•
Manufacturer advises that cases of microcysts, 
oncocytomas and collecting duct renal carcinoma 
have been reported in patients with severe renal 
impairment who received lithium for more than 10 
years.
•
Lithium generally should not be used in patients 
with severe renal disease because of increased risk of 
toxicity.
•
Dialysability: serum lithium concentrations rebound 
within 5–8 hours post haemodialysis because 
of redistribution of the drug, often necessitating 
repeated courses of haemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis 
is less effective at removing lithium and is only used if 
haemodialysis is not possible.
•
Up to one-third of patients on lithium may develop 
polyuria, usually due to lithium blocking the effect of 
ADH. This reaction is reversible on withdrawal of 
lithium therapy.

Metabolism
Lomitapide is metabolised extensively by the liver 
via oxidation, oxidative N-dealkylation, glucuronide 
conjugation, and piperidine ring opening. Cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes lomitapide to its major 
metabolites, M1 and M3, as detected in plasma. The 
oxidative N-dealkylation pathway breaks the lomitapide 
molecule into M1 and M3. M1 is the moiety that retains 
the piperidine ring, whereas M3 retains the rest of the 
lomitapide molecule 
in vitro
. CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 
2C19 may metabolise lomitapide to a small extent to 
M1. M1 and M3 do not inhibit activity of microsomal 
triglyceride transfer protein 
in vitro

is metabolised to an active carboxylic acid metabolite 
E-3174 (EXP-3174), which has greater pharmacological 
activity than losartan; some inactive metabolites are 
also formed. Metabolism is mainly by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
Losartan is excreted in the urine, and in the faeces via 
bile, as unchanged drug and metabolites. About 4% of an 
oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 6% is 
excreted in urine as the active metabolite.

•
Doses from BC Cancer Agency. Accessed

•
Manufacturer states that currently available 
pharmacokinetic data do not justify an absolute 
recommendation on dosage reduction when 
administering melphalan tablets to patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment, but it may 
be prudent to use a reduced dosage initially until 
tolerance is established.
•
When melphalan injection is used at conventional IV 
dosage (8–40 mg/m
2
BSA) in patients with moderate 
to severe renal impairment, it is recommended 
that the initial dose should be reduced by 50% and 
subsequent dosage be determined by the degree of 
haematological suppression.
•
For high IV doses of melphalan (100–240 mg/
m
2
BSA), the need for dose reduction depends 
upon the degree of renal impairment, whether 
autologous bone marrow stem cells are re-infused, 
and therapeutic need. High dose melphalan is not 
recommended in patients with more severe renal 
impairment (EDTA clearance less than 30 mL/
minute).
•
It should be borne in mind that dose reduction 
of melphalan in renal impairment is somewhat 
arbitrary. At moderate doses, where melphalan 
M
628
Melphalan
is used as part of a combined regimen, dosage 
reductions of up to 50% may be appropriate. 
However, at high doses, e.g. conditioning for bone 
marrow transplant, there is a risk of under-dosing 
the patient and not achieving the desired therapeutic 
effect, so the dose should be reduced with caution in 
these instances.
•
Adequate hydration and forced diuresis may be 
necessary in patients with poor renal function.
•
In myeloma patients with renal damage, temporary 
but significant increases in blood urea levels have

Metabolism
Extensively metabolised by first-pass metabolism in the 
liver via intracellular activation to an active metabolite.At 
conventional doses clearance is primarily hepatic. Renal 
clearance may become important at high doses.The active 
metabolites have a longer half-life than the parent drug. 
The main method of elimination for 6-mercaptopurine 
is by metabolic alteration. The kidneys eliminate 
approximately 7% of 6-mercaptopurine unaltered within 
12 hours of the drug being administered. Xanthine 
oxidase is the main catabolic enzyme of 6-mercaptopurine 
and it converts the drug into the inactive metabolite, 
6-thiouric acid. This is excreted in the urine.

•
Absorption of an oral dose is incomplete, averaging 
~50%. This is largely due to first-pass metabolism 
(less when given with food). There is enormous 
inter-individual variability in absorption, which can 
result in a 5-fold variation in AUC.
•
Manufacturer recommends reducing the dose in 
patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, 
although no specific dosing guidelines are available 
due to lack of data.
•
The following dosing intervals have been suggested 
in renal impairment: 24–36 hrs for CRCL of 50–80 
mL/min, and 48 hours for CRCL of 10–50 mL/
min. (Summerhayes M, Daniels S (ed).

A recent study on anti-cancer drug renal toxicity 
and elimination concluded that the dose of 
6-mercaptopurine does not require modification in 
patients with decreased renal function (except in 
conjunction with allopurinol). This study also gives 
percentage excreted unchanged in urine as 21%.

Metabolism
Meropenem is more stable to renal dehydropeptidase I 
than imipenem but undergoes some renal metabolism, 
and is mainly excreted in the urine by tubular secretion 
and glomerular filtration. About 70% of a dose is 
recovered unchanged in the urine over a 12-hour period. 
Meropenem is reported to have one metabolite (ICI-
213689), which is inactive and is excreted in the urine.

Differences in renal replacement doses are due to the 
different flow rates used in the studies.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be

•
Urinary output should be maintained at 100 mL/
hour (as required for oxazaphosphorine treatment).
•
The dose of mesna is dependent on the dose 
of oxazaphosphorine, e.g. reduce dose of 
cyclophosphamide to 50% of normal if GFR<10 
mL/min; hence, dose of mesna will consequently be 
reduced.
•
From what is known about the pharmacokinetics and 
mechanism of action of mesna, its availability in the 
urinary tract depends on renal function.
•
In the case of completely anuric patients 
(extremely rare) neither cyclophosphamide nor 
its metabolites should appear in the urinary tract: 
the use of mesna concomitantly may therefore be 
unnecessary in anuric patients. If there is any risk 
of cyclophosphamide or its metabolites entering the 
urinary tract, mesna should probably be given to 
prevent urothelial toxicity.
•
Limited kinetic information would suggest mesna 
would be eliminated by haemodialysis.

renal disease and suggests it can be used in patients 
with GFR>30 mL/min with careful monitoring and 
query the data which says it commonly causes lactic 
acidosis. (Herrington WG, Levy JB. Metformin: 
effective and safe in renal disease?

•
As metformin is renally excreted eGFR values 
should be determined before initiating treatment and 
regularly thereafter:
–
at least annually in patients with normal renal 
function
–
at least 2–4 times a year in patients with an eGFR at 
the lower limit of normal and in elderly subjects.

Metabolism
Under acid conditions methenamine is slowly hydrolysed 
to formaldehyde and ammonia. Almost no hydrolysis of 
methenamine takes place at physiological pH, and it is 
therefore virtually inactive in the body. Methenamine is 
rapidly and almost completely eliminated in the urine, 
and provided this is acidic (preferably below pH 5.5) 
bactericidal concentrations of formaldehyde occur. 
Because of the time taken for hydrolysis, however, these 
do not occur until the urine reaches the bladder.

Metabolism
Metabolism is via liver and intracellular metabolism to 
polyglutamated products. Methotrexate does not appear 
to undergo significant metabolism at low doses; after 
high-dose therapy the 7-hydroxy metabolite has been 
detected. Methotrexate may be partly metabolised by the 
intestinal flora after oral doses.
It is excreted mainly in the urine by glomerular filtration 
and active tubular secretion. Small amounts are excreted 
in bile and found in faeces; there is some evidence for 
enterohepatic recirculation.

methotrexate or its metabolites in renal tubules. A high 
fluid throughput and alkalinisation of urine, using sodium 
bicarbonate if necessary, is recommended.
Other information
•
Renal function should be closely monitored 
throughout treatment. If there is any deterioration 
in renal function methotrexate must be discontinued 
and discussed with the consultant who started 
treatment.
•

•
Calcium folinate (calcium leucovorin) is a potent 
agent for neutralising the immediate toxic effects of 
methotrexate on the haematopoietic system.
•
Calcium folinate rescue may begin 24/32/36 hours 
post start of methotrexate therapy, according to local 
protocol. Doses of up to 120 mg may be given over 
12–24 hours by IM or IV injection or infusion, 
followed by 12–15 mg IM, or 15 mg orally every 6 
hours for the next 48 hours.

A study of the pharmacokinetics of minoxidil in 
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment 
found that the non-renal clearance was also impaired 
as renal function worsened. Substantial accumulation 
of minoxidil might occur in these patients during 
multiple-dose therapy. Recommended that minoxidil 
therapy be initiated with smaller doses or a longer 
dose interval in patients with significant renal 
impairment.
•
Minoxidil is a peripheral vasodilator and should be 
given in conjunction with a diuretic to control salt 
and water retention, and a beta-blocker to control 
reflex tachycardia. Patients on dialysis do not need to 
be given minoxidil in conjunction with a diuretic.

Metabolism
The metabolic fate of both endogenous and recombinant 
erythropoietin is poorly understood. Current evidence 
from studies in animals suggests that hepatic metabolism 
contributes only minimally to elimination of the 
intact
hormone, but desialylated epoetin (i.e. terminal sialic 
acid groups removed) appears to undergo substantial 
hepatic clearance via metabolic pathways and/or binding. 
Desialylation and/or removal of the oligosaccharide side 
chains of erythropoietin appear to occur principally in 
the liver; bone marrow also may have a role in catabolism 
of the hormone. Elimination of desialylated drug by the 
kidneys, bone marrow, and spleen also may occur; results 
of animal studies suggest that proximal renal tubular 
secretion may be involved in renal elimination.

Metabolism
Mitomycin is a pro-drug, and is activated 
in vivo
 by 
metabolism mainly in the liver to a bifunctional and 
trifunctional alkylating agent. Binding to DNA leads 
to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and 
function. Rate of clearance is inversely proportional to 
the maximum serum concentration, due to saturation of 
the degradative pathways. Approximately 10% is excreted 
unchanged in the urine. Since metabolic pathways are 
saturated at low doses, the percentage dose excreted in the 
urine increases with increasing dose.

A syndrome of thrombotic microangiopathy 
resembling haemolytic uraemic syndrome has been 
seen in patients receiving mitomycin, either alone 
or, more frequently, combined with other agents. 
Symptoms of haemolysis and renal failure may be 
accompanied by ATN and cardiovascular problems, 
pulmonary oedema and neurological symptoms.
•
Principal toxicity of mitomycin-C is bone marrow 
suppression. The nadir is usually around 4 weeks 
after treatment and toxicity is cumulative, with 
increasing risk after each course of treatment.

Spontaneous recovery is complete in approximately 
15 minutes and is independent of dose administered.
•
In patients with CKD 5 the clinically effective 
duration of block produced by 0.15 mg/kg is 
approximately 1.5 times longer than in patients 
with normal renal function; hence, dosage should be 
adjusted according to individual clinical response.
•
Results from a study comparing 20 anephric patients 
with 20 healthy patients highlight the need for 
reduced dosages of Mivacron in patients with renal 
failure: patients with renal failure had a slightly shorter 
time to maximum depression of T1/T0, a slower 
recovery of T1/T0 to 5% (15.3 vs 9.8 min), required a 
slower infusion rate (6.3 vs 10.4 micrograms/kg/min) 
and experienced slower spontaneous recovery (12.2 vs 
7.7 min). The drug company has no specific guidelines 
as to the extent of dose reduction required.

Metabolism
Mycophenolate undergoes presystemic metabolism 
in the liver to active mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA 
undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and secondary 
increases in plasma MPA concentrations are seen; these 
have been reported at between 6–12 hours after a dose of 
mycophenolate mofetil, and at between 6–8 hours after 
a dose of mycophenolate sodium. MPA is metabolised 
by glucuronidation to the inactive mycophenolic acid 
glucuronide.
The majority of a dose of mycophenolate is excreted in 
the urine as this glucuronide, with negligible amounts of 
MPA; about 6% of a dose is recovered in faeces.

Mycophenolate sodium 720 mg is approximately

•
In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil, 
reduction in pre-dose concentration of the 
active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA) of 
approximately 50% has been reported after starting 
oral co-amoxiclav. The change in pre-dose level 
may not accurately represent changes in overall 
MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose 
of mycophenolate mofetil should not normally be 
necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft 
dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring 
should be performed during the combination and 
shortly after antibiotic treatment.

The SPC recommends a dose reduction if

 concluded that dosage adjustments may not 
be necessary with decreased renal function. The 
authors found an increase in the elimination half-life 
of 6-MNA, but stated that the increased half-life 
in patients with renal failure is offset by changes in 
the apparent volume of distribution that prevent 
the accumulation of 6-MNA. (Brier ME, Sloan

Naltrexone is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract but is subject to considerable first-pass metabolism 
and may undergo enterohepatic recycling. It is extensively 
metabolised in the liver and the major metabolite,

Nelarabine is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine analogue 
ara-G.
Extensive metabolism by O-demethylation by adenosine 
deaminase to form ara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to 
form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolysed 
to form methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form 
guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form xanthine, 
which is further oxidised to yield uric acid.
Nelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the 
kidneys.

Nevirapine is extensively metabolised by hepatic 
microsomal enzymes, mainly by the cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, to several inactive 
hydroxylated metabolites. Auto-induction of these 
enzymes results in a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in apparent 
oral clearance after 2–4 weeks at usual dosage, and a 
decrease in terminal half-life.
Nevirapine is mainly excreted in the urine as glucuronide 
conjugates of the hydroxylated metabolites.

•
Toxic plasma concentrations can occur in moderate

e.g. neuropathy, blood dyscrasias.
•
Advice from MHRA advises to avoid nitrofurantoin 
if GFR<60 mL/min due to risk of treatment 
failure as the drug is ineffective due to inadequate 
urine concentration. (MHRA.

•
An expert group from the MHRA has reconsidered 
nitrofurantoin. Their advice is for an amendment 
to the contraindication against use from CRCL<60 
mL/min to eGFR<45 mL/min, with additional 
advice that nitrofurantoin may be used with caution 
in individual cases as short-course therapy only for 
the treatment of lower UTI with an eGFR between 
30–44 mL/min to treat resistant pathogens, when 
the benefits may outweigh the risks of undesirable

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Cases of acute kidney injury have been reported in 
patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases, risk 
factors have been identified, such as pre-existing 
renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, 
overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic agents or, aged 
over 65. In all patients, IVIg administration requires:
–
adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the 
infusion of IVIg;
–
monitoring of urine output;
–
monitoring of serum creatinine levels;
–
avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics.
•
In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation 
should be considered. While reports of renal 
dysfunction and acute kidney injury have been 
associated with the use of many of the licensed IVIg 
products, those containing sucrose (compared to 
glycine, maltose or sorbitol) as a stabiliser accounted 
for a disproportionate share of the total number. In 
patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not 
contain sucrose may be considered. In addition, the 
product should be administered at the minimum 
concentration and infusion rate practicable.
•
Overdose may lead to fluid overload and 
hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, 
including elderly patients or patients with renal

Metabolism
Conjugated oestrogens taken orally are hydrolysed 
by enzymes present in the intestine that remove the 
sulfate group and allow absorption of the unconjugated 
oestrogen. Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver; a 
variety of sulfate and glucuronide conjugates are formed, 
and these are excreted in the urine and the bile. Those 
excreted in the bile undergo enterohepatic recycling or are 
excreted in the faeces.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Olsalazine is broken down by the colonic bacterial flora 
into 2 molecules of 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine). 
The small amounts (1–2% of the dose or less) of intact 
olsalazine that are absorbed are excreted mainly in urine.
Approximately 0.1% of an oral dose of olsalazine 
is hepatically metabolised to olsalazine-O-sulfate 
(olsalazine-S), which has a half-life of 7 days.

Metabolism
Ombitasvir is metabolised via amide hydrolysis followed 
by oxidative metabolism. A total of 13 metabolites 
were identified in human plasma. These metabolites 
are not expected to have antiviral activity or off-target 
pharmacologic activity.
Paritaprevir is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to 
a lesser extent CYP3A5. Following administration of 
a single 200 mg / 100 mg oral dose of 
14
C paritaprevir 
/ ritonavir to humans, the parent drug was the major 
circulating component, accounting for approximately 90% 
of the plasma radioactivity. At least 5 minor metabolites 
of paritaprevir have been identified in circulation that 
accounted for approximately 10% of plasma radioactivity. 
These metabolites are not expected to have antiviral 
activity.
Ritonavir is extensively metabolised in the liver mainly by 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and to a lesser 
extent by CYP2D6. Five metabolites have been identified 
and the major metabolite has antiviral activity, but 
concentrations in plasma are low.
About 86% of a dose is eliminated through the faeces 
(both as unchanged drug and as metabolites) and about 
11% is excreted in the urine.

Metabolism
Oseltamivir is a prodrug; it is extensively metabolised by 
esterases in the liver to the active carboxylate metabolite. 
Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolised and 
is eliminated entirely by renal excretion. Renal clearance 
exceeds glomerular filtration rate indicating that tubular 
secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less 
than 20% of an oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in 
faeces.

A study looked at oseltamivir clearance in patients 
undergoing aggressive peritoneal dialysis treatments 
and found a single dose of 75 mg oseltamivir 
provided exposure at the upper end of the safety 
margin. It was well tolerated in all the patients. (Patel

et al.

and safety of oseltamivir in patients with end-stage 
renal disease treated with automated peritoneal 
dialysis.

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

 evidence of cytochrome P450 
metabolism of the diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring. 
Several cytotoxic biotransformation products including 
the monochloro-, dichloro- and diaquo-DACH platinum 
species have been identified in the systemic circulation 
together with a number of inactive conjugates.
Platinum removal is mainly by renal excretion and tissue 
distribution; platinum metabolites mainly by renal

Metabolism
Metabolism is negligible. The tetracyclines are excreted 
in the urine and in the faeces. Renal clearance is by 
glomerular filtration. Up to 60% of an intravenous dose of 
tetracycline, and up to 55% of an oral dose, is eliminated 
unchanged in the urine. The tetracyclines are excreted in 
the bile, where concentrations 5–25 times those in plasma 
can occur. There is some enterohepatic reabsorption and 
considerable quantities occur in the faeces after oral doses.

Metabolism
The distribution and metabolism of paclitaxel 
in humans has not been fully investigated. The 
cumulative excretion of unchanged paclitaxel in the 
urine has been between 1.3% and 12.6% of the dose 
on average, which is an indication of extensive non-
renal clearance. Hepatic metabolism by the action of 
CYP450 enzyme and biliary clearance are possibly the 
principal mechanisms for elimination of paclitaxel. 
An average of 26% of the radioactively marked 
dose of paclitaxel was eliminated in the faeces as a

Metabolism
Panobinostat is extensively metabolised, and a large 
fraction of the dose is metabolised before reaching 
the systemic circulation by reduction, hydrolysis, 
oxidation and glucuronidation. Oxidative metabolism 
of panobinostat played a less prominent role, with 
approximately 40% of the dose eliminated by this 
pathway. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the main 
oxidation enzyme, with potential minor involvement of 
CYP2D6 and 2C19.
Panobinostat represented 6–9% of the drug-related 
exposure in plasma. The parent substance is deemed to 
be responsible for the overall pharmacological activity of 
panobinostat.
After a single oral dose of [
14
C]-panobinostat in patients, 
29–51% of administered radioactivity is excreted in the 
urine and 44–77% in the faeces. Unchanged panobinostat 
accounted for <2.5% of the dose in urine and <3.5% of 
the dose in faeces.

Metabolism
Parathyroid hormone is metabolised in the liver and to a 
lesser degree in the kidney. Parathyroid hormone is not 
excreted from the body in its intact form. Circulating 
carboxy-terminal fragments are filtered by the kidney, but 
are subsequently broken to even smaller fragments during 
tubular reuptake.
Parathyroid hormone is efficiently removed from the blood 
by a receptor-mediated process in the liver and is broken 
down into smaller peptide fragments. The fragments derived 
from the amino-terminus are further degraded within the 
cell while the fragments derived from the carboxy-terminius 
are released back into the blood and cleared by the kidney. 
These carboxy-terminal fragments are thought to play a role 
in the regulation of parathyroid hormone activity.

•
There is no data available in patients with severe

the manufacturer advises to use with caution in this 
group.
•
Some of the mechanisms of action of parathyroid 
hormone (e.g. conversion of 25-OH vitamin D 
to 1,25-OH2 vitamin D) are dependent on renal 
function.
•
Bioavailability is 53%.
•
Pharmacokinetics following a single 100 micrograms 
SC dose of parathyroid hormone was evaluated 
in 16 subjects with normal renal function and 16 
subjects with renal impairment. The mean maximum 
concentration (C
max
) of PTH following 100 
micrograms parathyroid hormone in subjects with 
mild-to-moderate renal impairment (CRCL=30–80 
mL/min) was approximately 23% higher than that 
observed in subjects with normal renal function. 
Exposure to PTH as measured by AUC
0-last
 and 
baseline-corrected AUC

was approximately 3.9% 
and 2.5%, respectively, higher than that observed for 
subjects with normal renal function.

Renal clearance has a minor contribution to the 
elimination of pasireotide. In a clinical study with

Metabolism
When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in 
the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I, an enzyme in the 
brush border of the renal tubules, to inactive, nephrotoxic 
metabolites, with only about 5 to 40 or 45% of a dose 
excreted in the urine as unchanged active drug.
Cilastin inhibits the metabolism of imipenem. When 
given with cilastatin about 70% of an intravenous dose of 
imipenem is recovered unchanged in the urine within 10 
hours. Cilastatin is also excreted mainly in the urine, the 
majority as unchanged drug and about 12% as 
N

•
Patients with GFR<5 mL/min should not receive 
drug unless HD is started within 48 hours.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Proguanil is metabolised in the liver to the active 
metabolite, cycloguanil, and to 
p
-chlorophenylbiguanide 
which is inactive, mainly by cytochrome P450, CYP 
2C19 and slightly by CYP 3A4. Unlike proguanil and 
p
-chlorophenylbiguanide, cycloguanil is not concentrated 
in erythrocytes so concentrations of cycloguanil in 
plasma and whole blood are similar. About 40–60% of 
a dose of proguanil is excreted in the urine, 60% of this 
as the unchanged drug, 30% as cycloguanil, and 8% as

Metabolism
Regorafenib is metabolised by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. 
The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib measured 
at steady-state in human plasma are M-2 (N-oxide) and 
M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl), both of them having 
similar 
in vitro
 pharmacological activity and steady-state 
concentrations as regorafenib. M-2 and M-5 are highly 
protein bound (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively).
Approximately 90% of the radioactive dose was recovered 
within 12 days after administration, with about 71% of 
the dose excreted in faeces (47% as parent compound, 
24% as metabolites), and about 19% of the dose 
excreted in urine as glucuronides. Urinary excretion of 
glucuronides decreased below 10% under steady-state 
conditions. Parent compound found in faeces could be 
derived from intestinal degradation of glucuronides 
or reduction of metabolite M-2 (N-oxide), as well as 
unabsorbed regorafenib.

There are two studies using ribavirin (200–400 
mg daily) in combination with interferon in 
haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. 
Anaemia was one of the main problems, resulting 
in either increased doses of erythropoietin or 
discontinuation of ribavirin therapy. Most patients 
were stabilised on a dose of 200 mg daily or 200 mg 
3 times a week. A dose of 200 mg daily gave troughs 
comparable to those in patients with normal renal 
function taking 1200 mg daily. (Bruchfeld A, Stahle

875
•
After stopping therapy the half-life was 
approximately 298 hours, due to slow elimination 
from non-plasma compartments.
•
Ribavirin is also available (on named patient basis) as 
an intravenous infusion, from ICN Pharmaceuticals.
•
Recommended IV dosing schedule in patients with 
normal renal function is:
–
Initial loading dose: 33 mg/kg
–
Six hours after the initial dose: 16 mg/kg every 6 
hours for 4 days (16 doses)
–
Eight hours following the last of these doses: 8 mg/
kg every 8 hours for 3 days (9 doses).
•
Patients with impaired renal function should be 
carefully monitored during therapy with ribavirin for 
signs and symptoms of toxicity, such as haemolytic 
anaemia.
–
Available clinical experience suggests that patients 
with renal insufficiency and CRCL=50–80 mL/min 
tolerate the usual dosage regimen of ribavirin.
–
Individuals with moderate to severe renal 
insufficiency (CRCL=30–50 mL/min) have 
tolerated, without reports of complications, a dose 
regimen with an initial loading dose of 20–25 mg/
kg, followed by single daily doses of 10 mg/kg for 
9–10 consecutive days.
–
There is no experience in patients with end-stage 
renal disease.

Metabolism
Ribociclib is hepatically metabolised via CYP3A4 by 
oxidation. Ribociclib was the main circulating drug in 
plasma (44%). The major circulating metabolites included 
metabolite M13 (CCI284, N-hydroxylation), M4 (LEQ803, 
N-demethylation), and M1 (secondary glucuronide). 
Clinical activity of ribociclib was due mainly to parent drug, 
with negligible contribution from circulating metabolites.
Unchanged drug accounted for 17.3% and 12.1% of 
the dose in faeces and urine, respectively. Metabolite 
LEQ803 represented approximately 13.9% and 3.74% 
of the administered dose in faeces and urine, respectively. 
Numerous other metabolites were detected in both faeces 
and urine in minor amounts (≤2.78%).
Ribociclib and its metabolites are eliminated mainly via 
faeces (69.1%), with a small contribution from the renal 
route (22.6%).

•
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
including, but not limited to, the following must 
be avoided: clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, 
telithromycin, verapamil and voriconazole.
•
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
may therefore lead to decreased exposure and 
consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. The 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should 
be avoided, including, but not limited to, phenytoin, 
rifampicin, carbamazepine and St John's wort.
•
Caution and monitoring for toxicity are advised 
during concomitant treatment with sensitive 
substrates of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, 
OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and 
BSEP which exhibit a narrow therapeutic index, 
including but not limited to digoxin, pravastatin, 
rosuvastatin and metformin.
•
Co-administration of Kisqali with medicinal 
products with a known potential to prolong the 
QT interval such as anti-arrhythmic medicinal 
products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol), 
and other medicinal products that are known to 
prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited 
to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin,

Rifampicin is rapidly metabolised in the liver mainly 
to active 25-O-deacetylrifampicin and excreted in the 
bile. Deacetylation diminishes intestinal reabsorption 
and increases faecal excretion, although significant 
enterohepatic circulation still takes place. About 60% 
of a dose eventually appears in the faeces. The amount 
excreted in the urine increases with increasing doses 
and up to 30% of a dose may be excreted in the urine, 
about half of it being unchanged drug. The metabolite 
formylrifampicin is also excreted in the urine.

Metabolism
Risperidone is metabolised in the liver by CYP 2D6 
to its main active metabolite, 9-hydroxy-risperidone 
(paliperidone), which has a similar pharmacological 
activity as risperidone. This hydroxylation is subject to 
genetic polymorphism. Oxidative 
N
-dealkylation is a 
minor metabolic pathway.
Excretion is mainly in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in 
the faeces.

Metabolism
The mechanisms involved in the metabolism and 
elimination of rituximab are not fully understood, it 
is postulated that rituximab is most likely removed by 
opsonization via the reticuloendothelial system when 
bound to B lymphocytes, or by human antimurine 
antibody production. It is then degraded nonspecifically 
in the liver and excreted in the urine.

Metabolism
Rocuronium is metabolised by the liver to a less active 
metabolite, 17-desacetylrocuronium which is reported to 
have weak neuromuscular blocking effect.
Up to 40% of a dose may be excreted in the urine within 
24 hours; rocuronium is also excreted in the bile. After 
injection of a radiolabelled dose of rocuronium bromide, 
excretion of the radiolabel is on average 47% in urine 
and 43% in faeces after 9 days. Approximately 50% is 
recovered as the parent compound. No metabolites are 
detected in plasma.

•
Treatment of patients on dialysis: The dosing 
recommended is from limited data. Other 
dosing regimens may be more suitable from an 
efficacy perspective. However, due to increased 
metabolite exposure and lack of knowledge on the 
potential safety consequences of these exposures, 
dose modification should be followed by careful 
monitoring of safety and efficacy in individual 
patients.
•
No data is available for dosing patients who are 
undergoing peritoneal dialysis or continuous 
venovenous haemofiltration.
•
Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg, the 
exposure of ruxolitinib was similar in subjects with 
various degrees of renal impairment and in those 
with normal renal function. However, plasma AUC 
values of ruxolitinib metabolites tended to increase 
with increasing severity of renal impairment, and 
were most markedly increased in the subjects with 
severe renal impairment. It is unknown whether the 
increased metabolite exposure is of safety concern. A 
dose modification is recommended in patients with 
severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease. 
Dosing only on dialysis days reduces the metabolite 
exposure, but also the pharmacodynamic effect, 
especially on the days between dialysis.

Metabolism
There are three routes of hepatic metabolism. The main 
route involves hydrolytic oxidation of the amide moiety 
leading to the main metabolite safinamide acid (NW-
1153). Another pathway involves oxidative cleavage of 
the ether bond forming '
O
-debenzylated safinamide' 
(NW-1199). Finally the '
N
-dealkylated acid' (NW-1689) 
is formed by oxidative cleavage of the amine bond of 
either safinamide (minor) or the primary safinamide acid 
metabolite (NW-1153) (major). The '
N
-dealkylated acid' 
(NW-1689) undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid 
yielding its acyl glucuronide. None of these metabolites 
are pharmacologically active.
In humans, safinamide is almost exclusively eliminated via 
metabolism of which 76% is renal and 1.5% via the faeces.

Saquinavir is absorbed to a limited extent (about 30%) 
after oral doses of the mesilate and undergoes extensive 
first-pass hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450 
isoenzyme, CYP3A4 to form a range of mono- and 
di-hydroxylated inactive compounds.
It is excreted mainly in the faeces.

•
Oral bioavailability is 40%.
•
For PAH, the dose can be reduced to twice daily if 
there are problems with tolerability.
•
Dialysis is not expected to increase clearance as 
sildenafil is highly protein bound.
•
Patients should seek prompt medical advice if their 
erections last for more than 4 hours.
•
Recommend use on non-dialysis days due to 
hypotension. In peritoneal dialysis, treatment with

•
Anecdotally it has been used at Guy’s Hospital, 
London for diabetic gastroparesis at a dose of 25 mg 
3 times a day.
•
The use of sildenafil is potentially hazardous in 
patients with active coronary ischaemia, those with 
congestive heart failure, and those with complicated 
multi-drug antihypertensive therapy regimens.
•
In 9 patients on maintenance haemodialysis, 
sildenafil 50 mg appeared to produce firmer erections 
and greater sexual satisfaction, but the effects were 
prolonged for up to 48 hours after administration.

Metabolism
Simvastatin is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
and must be hydrolysed to its active 
β
-hydroxyacid form. 
Other active metabolites have been detected and several 
inactive metabolites are also formed. Simvastatin is a 
substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 
and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the 
liver, its primary site of action. Less than 5% of an oral 
dose has been reported to reach the circulation as active 
metabolites.
Simvastatin is mainly excreted in the faeces via the bile 
as metabolites. About 10–15% is recovered in the urine, 
mainly in inactive forms.

Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolised to cyanide in 
erythrocytes and smooth muscle and, this is then followed 
by the release of nitric oxide, the active metabolite. 
Cyanide is further metabolised in the liver to thiocyanate, 
which is slowly excreted in the urine.

Metabolism
Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that is extensively 
metabolised. The active metabolite is formed in 
hepatocytes and not observed in plasma. The 
predominant (>90%) metabolite, GS-331007, is 
inactive. It is formed through sequential and parallel 
pathways to the formation of active metabolite. The 
metabolic pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the 
carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A 
or carboxylesterase 1 and phosphoramidate cleavage 
by histidine triad nucleotide binding protein followed 
by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide 
biosynthesis pathway.
Dephosphorylation results in the formation of nucleoside 
metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently 
rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity 
in vitro
.
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [
14
C]-sofosbuvir, 
mean total recovery of the dose was >92%, consisting of 
approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, 
faeces, and expired air, respectively. This data indicate 
that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for 
GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted.

looking at giving 400 mg sofosbuvir to patients with 
severe renal impairment. They also reviewed another 
paper which used full dose sofosbuvir in severe renal 
impairment, they found an increase in adverse effects 
especially anaemia and recommend using full dose

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Sulindac is metabolised by reversible reduction to the 
sulfide metabolite, which appears to be the active form, 
and by irreversible oxidation to the sulfone metabolite.
About 50% is excreted in the urine mainly as the sulfone 
metabolite and its glucuronide conjugate, with smaller 
amounts of sulindac and its glucuronide conjugate; about 
25% appears in the faeces, primarily as sulfone and sulfide 
metabolites. Sulindac and its metabolites are also excreted 
in bile and undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation.

Metabolism
Tacrolimus is extensively bound to erythrocytes in the 
blood, and variations in red cell binding account for much 
of the variability in pharmacokinetics. It is extensively 
metabolised in the liver, mainly by cytochrome P450 
isoenzyme CYP3A4, and excreted, primarily in bile, 
almost entirely as metabolites. Considerable metabolism 
also occurs in the intestinal wall.
There are several metabolites identified. Only one of 
these has been shown
 in vitro 
to have immunosuppressive 
activity similar to that of tacrolimus. The other 
metabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive 
activity. In systemic circulation only one of the inactive 
metabolites is present at low concentrations. Therefore, 
metabolites do not contribute to pharmacological activity 
of tacrolimus.

Tamoxifen is extensively metabolised by cytochrome 
P450 isoenzymes, to active metabolites that include 
N-desmethyltamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 
4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen). 
Metabolism is by hydroxylation, demethylation and 
conjugation.
In-vitro
 studies suggest that both N-desmethyltamoxifen 
and 4-hydroxytamoxifen are further metabolised to 
endoxifen.
Elimination occurs, chiefly as conjugates with practically 
no unchanged drug, principally through the faeces and to 
a lesser extent through the kidneys.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be

Metabolism
Tegafur is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and uracil reversibly 
inhibits DPD, the primary catabolic enzyme for 5-FU. 
Metabolism occurs in the liver. Conversion of tegafur to 
5-FU occurs via C-5' oxidation (microsomal enzymes) 
and C-2' hydrolysis (cytosolic enzymes). Microsomal 
oxidation of tegafur is partially mediated by CYP2A6. 
The cytosolic enzymes responsible for the metabolism 
of tegafur are not known. Other metabolic products of 
tegafur include 3'-hydroxy tegafur, 4'-hydroxy tegafur, and 
dihydro tegafur which are all significantly less cytotoxic 
than 5-FU. The metabolism of 5-FU formed from tegafur 
follows the intrinsic 
de novo
 pathways for the naturally 
occurring pyrimidine, uracil.

 studies have shown that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 
2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2J2, 3A4, 3A5 and 4F12 are able 
to metabolise telavancin, resulting in hydroxylation at the 
7, 8 and 9 position of the 2-(decylamino) ethyl side chain 
of telavancin.
In a mass balance study in male subjects using 
radiolabelled telavancin, 3 hydroxylated metabolites were 
identified with the predominant metabolite (THRX-
651540) accounting for <10% of the radioactivity in urine 
and <2% of the radioactivity in plasma.
Renal excretion is the major route of elimination for 
telavancin in humans. In healthy young adults, after 
infusion of radiolabelled telavancin, approximately 76% 
of the administered dose was recovered from urine 
and less than 1% of the dose was recovered from faeces 
(collected for up to 9 days), based on total radioactivity. 
Telavancin is mainly excreted unchanged accounting for 
approximately 82% of the total amount recovered over 48 
hours in urine.

The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/

•
Lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, and usually 
associated with severe hepatomegaly and steatosis, 
has been reported in patients receiving nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
•
Following a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir, subjects 
with a calculated CRCL<50 mL/min, and those 
with ESRF requiring dialysis, had substantial 
reductions in renal elimination of tenofovir, 
resulting in high systemic exposures necessitating an 
adjustment in dose.
•
A 4-hour high-flux haemodialysis session was found 
to remove 10% of tenofovir from plasma.
•
Renal impairment, which may include 
hypophosphataemia, has been reported with the use 
of tenofovir. The majority of these cases occurred in 
patients with underlying systemic or renal disease, 
or in patients taking nephrotoxic agents – monitor 
creatinine clearance and phosphate levels.

Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide. 
It is moderately metabolised and teriflunomide is 
the only component detected in plasma. The main 
biotransformation pathway is hydrolysis with oxidation 
being a minor pathway. Secondary pathways involve 
oxidation, N-acetylation and sulfate conjugation.
Teriflunomide is excreted in the gastrointestinal tract 
mainly through the bile as unchanged drug and most 
likely by direct secretion.

Metabolism
Theophylline is metabolised in the liver to 
1,3-dimethyluric acid, 1-methyluric acid, and 
3-methylxanthine. Demethylation to 3-methylxanthine 
(and possibly to 1-methylxanthine) is catalysed by the 
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2; hydroxylation 
to 1, 3-dimethyluric acid is catalysed by CYP2E1 and 
CYP3A3. Both the demethylation and hydroxylation 
pathways of theophylline metabolism are capacity-limited, 
resulting in non-linear elimination. The metabolites are 
excreted in the urine. In adults, about 10% of a dose of 
theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine.

CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor 
metabolism and the formation of the active metabolite 
and their interactions with other CYP3A substrates 
ranges from activation through to inhibition.
The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is 
approximately 30–40% of that obtained for ticagrelor.
The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is via hepatic 
metabolism. The primary route of elimination for the 
active metabolite is most likely via biliary secretion.

•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Tinzaparin sodium (LMWH)

•
Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of 
aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia particularly in 
patients with chronic renal impairment and diabetes 
mellitus.
•
Low molecular weight heparins are renally excreted 
and hence accumulate in severe renal impairment. 
While the doses recommended for prophylaxis 
against DVT and prevention of thrombus formation 
in extracorporeal circuits are well tolerated in 
patients with CKD 5, the doses recommended for 
treatment of DVT and PE have not yet been verified 
as safe. LMWHs have been associated with severe, 
sometimes fatal, bleeding episodes in such patients. 
Hence the use of unfractionated heparin would be 
preferable in these instances.
•
Information from Leo Pharma states that tinzaparin 
can safely be used in elderly patients with a GFR>20 
mL/min for 10 days without any accumulation 
(Nagge J, Crowther M, Hirsh J. Is impaired renal 
function a contraindication to the use of low-

Metabolism
Tioguanine undergoes extensive metabolism in the 
liver and other tissues to several active and inactive 
metabolites. Tioguanine is inactivated mainly by 
methylation to aminomethylthiopurine; small amounts 
are deaminated to thioxanthine, and may go on to 
be oxidised by xanthine oxidase to thiouric acid, but 
inactivation is essentially independent of xanthine oxidase 
and is not affected by inhibition of the enzyme. 24–46% 
of the dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. It is 
excreted in the urine almost entirely as metabolites.

There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from 
the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab is 
concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear 
and non-linear clearance. The concentration-dependent 
non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab 
concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is 
saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance 
is mainly determined by the linear clearance.

Metabolism
Metabolised mainly by deacetylation alone or in 
combination with mono-oxygenation. The deacetylated 
metabolite was further metabolised by glucuronidation. 
CYP3A4 oxidation is considered a minor pathway 
of metabolism. The deacetylation is mediated by 
the carboxyl-esterases 1b, 1c and 2, with possible 
contributions by other hydrolytic enzymes.
Total dose recovery was low after a 10-day collection 
period (<50%) following administration of a single 
oral dose of radiolabelled trametinib, due to the long 
elimination half-life. Trametinib was excreted mainly 
in the faeces (>80% of recovered radioactivity) and to a 
minor extent in urine (≤19%).

Other information
•
Mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on 
trametinib exposure (<6% for either group). No data 
are available in patients with severe renal impairment 
although unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect due 
to the low renal excretion of trametinib.
•
Oral bioavailability is 72%.
•
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking 
trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with 
dabrafenib. Renal failure has also been reported in 
combination with dabrafenib.
•
There is a case report of a haemodialysis patient 
being treated with dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily and 
trametinib 1 mg once daily. The patient developed 
diarrhoea so treatment was stopped. Once resolved 
the dabrafenib was restarted at 50 mg once daily. 
After 2 months there was some tumour response. 
The patient developed skin toxicities so trametinib 
was restarted at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily with 
anti-diarrhoeal treatment to control the side effects.

Metabolism
The metabolic pathway of trospium in humans has not 
been fully defined. Of the 10% of the dose absorbed, 
metabolites account for approximately 40% of the 
excreted dose following oral administration. The major 
metabolic pathway is hypothesised as ester hydrolysis 
with subsequent conjugation of benzylic acid to form 
azoniaspironortropanol with glucuronic acid.
The mean renal clearance for trospium (29 L/hour) is 
4-fold higher than average glomerular filtration rate, 
indicating that active tubular secretion is a major route of 
elimination for trospium. There may be competition for 
elimination with other compounds that are also renally 
eliminated.

Metabolism
Valaciclovir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract after oral doses, and is rapidly and almost completely 
converted to aciclovir and valine by first-pass intestinal or 
hepatic metabolism.
Aciclovir is converted to a small extent to the metabolites 
9(carboxymethoxy)methylguanine (CMMG) by alcohol 
and aldehyde dehydrogenase and to 8-hydroxy-aciclovir 
(8-OH-ACV) by aldehyde oxidase. Approximately 88% 
of the total combined plasma exposure is attributable 
to aciclovir, 11% to CMMG and 1% to 8-OH-ACV. 
Valaciclovir is eliminated mainly as aciclovir and its 
metabolite 9- CMMG; less than 1% of a dose of 
valaciclovir is excreted unchanged in the urine.

•
Bioavailability of aciclovir from 1 g oral dose of 
valaciclovir is 54%.
•
Mean peak aciclovir concentrations occur 1.5 hours 
post dose; peak plasma concentrations of valaciclovir 
are 4% of aciclovir levels, occur at a median of 30–60 
minutes post dose, and are at or below the limit of 
quantification 3 hours post dose.
•
The dose quoted in the literature for CMV 
prophylaxis in transplant recipients is 2 g 4 times 
a day. However, in practice this results in severe 
aciclovir toxicity, especially in patients with poorly 
functioning grafts.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis

900 mg valganciclovir twice daily is therapeutically 
equivalent to 5 mg/kg intravenous ganciclovir twice 
daily.
•
Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir.
•
Take with food if possible.
•
It is recommended that complete blood counts 
and platelet counts be monitored during therapy 
especially in patients with renal impairment.
•
Approximately 50% of ganciclovir is removed by 
haemodialysis.
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

activity (approximately 20% that of the parent compound).
Norverapamil represents about 6% of the dose eliminated 
in urine and reaches steady-state plasma concentrations 
approximately equal to those of verapamil. About 70% 
of a dose is excreted by the kidneys in the form of its

From pharmacokinetic data they concluded that 
giving 1 g ceftolozane / 0.5 g tazobactam to this 
patient would have given similar AUC profile 
as a patient with normal renal function given 2 
g ceftolozane / 1 g tazobactam. Therefore they 
concluded that normal dosing may be used in CRRT 
but that more studies are required to confirm this

Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam sodium)
•
There are several methods of dosing drugs while a 
patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement 
therapy (CRRT) including the following guideline: 
The patient’s GFR is equated to the total fluid ‘flux’ 
within the filter circuit by adding up all the fluid 
going through the filter circuit i.e. blood flow, citrate, 
dialysate fluid and replacement fluid and dividing it 
by 60, which gives a value in mL /minute, equated to 
a patient GFR. E.g. blood flow rate = 100 mL/min, 
filtration fluid flow rate = 1000 mL/hr, dialysis flow 
rate = 1000 mL/hr, replacement rate (post filter) = 
200 mL/hr – this gives a CRRT dose of 2200 mL/
hr. This is then divided by 60 to give an approximate 
GFR of 36.7 mL/min. Dose would then be 
according to the GFR rather than using the dialysis 
recommendations.

Metabolism
Ziconotide is a peptide consisting of 25 naturally-
occurring amino acids and does not appear to be 
metabolised in the CSF. Once in the systemic circulation, 
ziconotide is expected to be mainly susceptible to 
proteolytic cleavage by various peptidases/proteases 
present in most organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, 
etc.), and then degraded to peptide fragments and its 
individual constituent free amino acids. These amino 
acids are expected to be taken up by cellular carrier 
systems and either subjected to normal intermediary 
metabolism or used as substrates for constitutive 
biosynthetic processes. Due to the wide distribution 
of these peptidases it is not expected that hepatic or 
renal impairment would affect the systemic clearance of 
ziconotide.
The biological activity of the various proteolytic 
degradation products has not been assessed although they 
are unlikely to have significant activity.

Metabolism
Zidovudine is metabolised intracellularly to the antiviral 
triphosphate. It is also metabolised in the liver, mainly to 
the inactive glucuronide, and is excreted in the urine as 
unchanged drug and metabolite.
The 5'-glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite 
in both plasma and urine, accounting for approximately 
50–80% of the administered dose eliminated by renal 
excretion. There is substantial accumulation of this 
metabolite in renal failure.
Renal clearance of zidovudine greatly exceeds creatinine 
clearance, indicating that significant tubular secretion 
takes place.

Metabolism
Zolmitriptan is eliminated largely by hepatic 
biotransformation followed by urinary excretion of the 
metabolites. There are three major metabolites: the 
indole acetic acid, (the major metabolite in plasma and 
urine), the N-oxide and N-desmethyl analogues. Only 
the N-desmethylated metabolite is active. The primary 
metabolism of zolmitriptan is mediated mainly by the 
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 while monoamine 
oxidase type A is responsible for further metabolism of the 
N

Zonisamide is metabolised mainly by reductive cleavage 
of the benzisoxazole ring of the parent drug by CYP3A4 
to form 2-sulphamoylacetylphenol (SMAP) and also 
by N-acetylation. Parent drug and SMAP can also be 
glucuronidated.
The metabolites, which could not be detected in 
plasma, are inactive. Excretion is mainly in the urine; 
about 15 to 30% appearing as unchanged drug, 15% 
as 
N
-acetylzonisamide, and 50% as the glucuronide of 
SMAP.

Drugs for malaria prophylaxis
The malaria prophylaxis regimens below reflect the guidelines agreed by UK malaria specialists, and are aimed at 
residents of the UK who travel to endemic areas. Because the drug sensitivities of malaria parasites change with time 
and place, the most up-to-date information on prophylaxis should always be obtained from an appropriate travel clinic.
Mefloquine (Lariam®)
•
250 mg (ONE tablet) ONCE a WEEK, starting 2–3 weeks prior to travelling and continuing for 4 weeks after 
returning.
•
NO dose changes are require
d for patients with any degree of renal impairment.
Doxycycline
•
100 mg (ONE capsule) ONCE a DAY starting 1–2 days prior to travelling and continuing for 4 weeks after 
returning.
•
CAPD or HAEMODIALYSIS patients
 – No dose adjustment required.
•
TRANSPLANT patients
 – Doxycycline can DOUBLE the blood levels of Ciclosporin and Tacrolimus. Advise 
to commence taking the doxycycline at least 1 week prior to travelling to enable ciclosporin or tacrolimus levels to 
be monitored and adjusted as necessary.
Chloroquine (Avloclor® or Nivaquine®) and Proguanil (Paludrine®)
•
CHLOROQUINE (base) 310 mg (TWO tablets) ONCE a WEEK, 
plus
•
PROGUANIL 200 mg (TWO tablets) ONCE a DAY starting 1 week prior to travelling and continuing for 4 
weeks after returning.
Chloroquine:
•
Malaria 
prophylaxis
: no dose adjustment necessary for renal impairment.
•
Malaria 
treatment, i.e. full therapeutic dose:
 take the following into consideration:
–
TRANSPLANT patients: 
Chloroquine increases plasma Ciclosporin levels – monitor carefully.
Patients with renal insufficiency:
GFR (mL/min) 20–59
100% dose.
GFR (mL/min) 10–19
100% dose.
GFR (mL/min) <10
50% dose.
Proguanil:
•
TRANSPLANT patients:
 Dose according to the level of function of the renal transplant.
•
CAPD and HAEMODIALYSIS patients: 
half a tablet (50 mg) once a week
.
Patients with renal insufficiency:
GFR (mL/min) >60
200 mg OD.
GFR (mL/min) 20–59
100 mg OD.
GFR (mL/min) 10–19
50 mg alt days.
GFR (mL/min) <10
50 mg once a week.
Patients with renal insufficiency receiving proguanil should also be prescribed folic acid 5 mg daily to minimise side 
effects.
Atovaquone 250 mg + Proguanil 100 mg (Malarone®)
ONE tablet daily starting 1–2 days before travelling, and continuing for 7 days after returning.
Atovaquone + Proguanil dose
GFR (mL/min) >30
Normal dose.
GFR (mL/min) <30
Malarone not recommended, because with the combined preparation it is not possible to 
reduce the dose of proguanil but take the full dose of atovaquone. Use alternative therapy.
